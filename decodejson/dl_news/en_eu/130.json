As a result, the text &quot;0.25%&quot; was mistakenly changed to &quot;0.1178,&quot; and &quot;2.25&quot; was mistakenly changed to &quot;2.1178.&quot;<br><br>Some players were concerned that the appearance rate increase is lower than it actually is, but this issue affected the text alone, not the actual appearance rate increase. We have verified that the actual appearance rate increase is 0.25%.<br><br>Thank you for your understanding.</div><div><br></div><div>Thank you for playing Dragalia Lost.</div>,start_time:1543699800,update_time1555572219
