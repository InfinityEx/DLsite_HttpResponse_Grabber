Tapping the gauge<br>after it has filled to a certain threshold will allow<br>the user to shapeshift, and when shapeshifting,<br>the user will unleash their heavenly wings to<br>transform into their unique form regardless of<br>what dragon they are equipped with. By tapping<br>the gauge a second time or after the gauge has<br>been consumed, the user will return to their<br>original form. While shapeshifted, the user's<br>standard attacks will fill their unique shapeshift<br>gauge.<br><br>Also, grants the user a skill reservoir with<br>three levels. This skill reservoir is filled when<br>using standard attacks, when force strikes<br>connect with enemies, or by other conditions<br>that fill skill gauges.<br><br>In addition, at the start of quests, grants the user<br>the "Coordination Protocol" effect. If the user<br>continues to charge their force strike, the effect<br>granted to them will change every 1.5 seconds.<br>The effect will cycle between the "Coordination<br>Protocol" and "Concentration Protocol" effects.<br><br>Using the user's first or second skills, including<br>their skills while shapeshifted, will grant them a<br>defense amp with a maximum team amp level<br>of three. After this amp is granted, this ability<br>will not grant it again for 20 seconds.</div></dd><dt><span><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/e23fa30b574bf7f565547e4d26946c1f2.png"></span><span>Stun Res +100%</span></dt><dd><div>Reduces susceptibility to stun by 100%.</div></dd><dt><span><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/de137cf7302f5717d1be863dbd4a45e62.png"></span><span>Combat Coordinator II</span></dt><dd><div>The user's unique shapeshift gauge is partially<br>filled when their HP is restored.<br>After activating, this ability will not activate<br>again for 10 seconds.</div></dd></dl></div></div></div><div><br></div><div>・The stats shown here do not include increases or decreases due to abilities and represent the adventurers at level 80 with 50 mana nodes unlocked, not the stats when first obtained.</div><div>・Some skills have different effects when used as a shared skill.</div><div><br></div><div>Notes:</div><div>1.
