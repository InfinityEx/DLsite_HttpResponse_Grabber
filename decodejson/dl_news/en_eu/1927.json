More space would be beneficial for players who wish to arrange their facilities in aesthetically pleasing layouts.</div><div><br></div><div>Okada: We plan to increase the Halidom&#39;s buildable area in a future update and kindly ask for your patience in the meantime.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: Players have commented that the stamina costs of the various quests in the game are too high and should be reduced.</div><div><br></div><div>Okada: Players who have just begun their Dragalia Lost journey and players who are returning to continue their journey have told us that the stamina costs of quests are high even when the potential stamina recovery from items is taken into account. We will consider adjusting the stamina costs in light of changes made since the game&#39;s release, including the increasing number of quests available to players and the design of the quests themselves.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: At present, steel bricks are only used to unbind 4★ core weapons, meaning that players can quickly end up with a surplus of this particular material. Since many players end up with more steels bricks than they can use, why not allow players to exchange them for other materials or items?</div><div><br></div><div>Okada: It is true that some players have commented that they haven&#39;t used any steel bricks since unbinding all of their 4★ core weapons after the weapon system changes implemented in the Version 2.0 update. We will consider ways to resolve this issue, including allowing players to exchange steel bricks for other items as suggested above.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: While players are appreciative of the feature that allows them to conveniently retry a quest, they often feel the need to tweak their team&#39;s members or equipment before trying again, so it would be better if the retry feature took players to the Edit Teams screen instead of restarting the quest with the same team that previously failed it.</div><div><br></div><div>Okada: This can be particularly troublesome in co-op, right? Once a quest has started, players may need to leave the room in order to switch up their equipment, and rejoining the exact same room that you left can be difficult since the &quot;Up for Anything&quot; category is so broad. We will consider a feature that allows players to return to the preparation screen so that they can tweak their team to eke out that extra bit of performance needed to clear the quest or address any setup issues that they might have missed the first time around.</div><div><br></div><hr><div>Director Okada will continue to reply to the feedback players send via Leave Feedback again in the future. We&#39;re looking forward to hearing your comments. (The feedback featured in the next notification will be chosen from feedback received between December 1 and December 31.)</div><div><br></div><div>Thank you for playing Dragalia Lost.</div>,start_time:1610690400,update_time1610677983
