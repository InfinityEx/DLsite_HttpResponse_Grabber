If you play the event, you&#39;ll have the chance to build one for your Castle Grounds!<br><br>The cleansing fount boosts the stats of adventurers who wield daggers or manacasters. It also boosts the damage that adventurers deal against enemies in event quests. Progress through the event story and level up your cleansing fount!<br><br>Equip the event-specific wyrmprint Extreme Teamwork to receive more sacred stones, which are used to upgrade the cleansing fount. You can also equip the wyrmprint Rivalry of Kings (available from the Treasure Trade for wyrmprints) to receive more intelligence when clearing quests. Use these wyrmprints to get the most out of this event!<br><br>Please note that special effects conferred by event-specific wyrmprints do not apply if you begin a quest during the event period but complete the quest after the event period has ended.<br><br>■Additions<br>・New maximum level unlocked for the event facility!<br>The cleansing fount event facility can now be leveled up to a maximum of level 35.<br><br>■Event Duration<br><span class="local_date" data-local_date="1631685600"></span> to <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1635227999"></span><br><br>■Reward Availability Period<br><span class="local_date" data-local_date="1631685600"></span> to <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1635832799"></span><br><br>■Event-Exclusive Facility: Cleansing Fount<br>This facility increases the stats of adventurers who use daggers or manacasters.

Rewards vary depending on the difficulty cleared. This quest can be played either solo or co-op.<br><br>■Extra Boss Battles<br>Although the difficulty level of extra boss battles is higher than the event boss battle on Expert difficulty, the rewards are generous and the battles do not cost stamina or getherwings. Extra boss battles occasionally appear after clearing the event boss battle on Expert difficulty.<br><br>Even if you clear the boss battle several times in a row using the auto-repeat feature, the extra boss battle will only become available once at most. It will disappear again after being successfully cleared. Once the conditions for the quest are met, you can unlock it repeatedly. This quest can be played either solo or co-op.<br><br>■Challenge Battles<br>Challenge battles are high-difficulty quests limited to solo play and are available in Expert, Master, and Nightmare difficulties.

If you fail to reach the last wave in Expert or Master difficulty, you will still receive rewards for the ones you did clear, but in Nightmare difficulty you must complete the final wave to earn rewards.<br><br>Finally, the drop rate for rewards differs based on the difficulty. The drop rate for rewards in Nightmare difficulty is the same as Master difficulty. Once per day when you clear Nightmare difficulty, you can get a Grand Bounty. The Grand Bounty you receive is randomly selected from a set of rewards.<br><br>■Intelligence Rewards<br>Intelligence points are event-exclusive points that can be earned by clearing event quests. Collect them to earn all kinds of rewards!<br><br>■Treasure Trade Rewards<br>You can earn sanctified water and paradise grain by playing event quests and trade them for various rewards on the Treasure Trade menu.
