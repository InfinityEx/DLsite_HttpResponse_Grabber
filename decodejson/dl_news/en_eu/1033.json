article_id:1033,category_name:News,title_name:Regarding Adjustments to Adventurers With Mana Spirals,image_path:,message:<div>Hello there! Yuji Okada here, director of Dragalia Lost.</div><div><br></div><div>I wanted to provide a brief explanation about the intention behind the adjustments to adventurers with mana spirals.</div><div><br></div><div>・In January, more 5★ adventurers will be able to unlock the mana spiral, but we&#39;re planning on unlocking the mana spiral for 3★ and 4★ shadow-attuned adventurers in February, so please wait just a little longer for that.</div><div><br></div><div>・Speaking of shadow-attuned adventurers with the mana spiral unlocked, it&#39;s already unlocked for Cassandra and Ieyasu, but with the adventurers being added this time, you&#39;ll be able to create a team that poisons enemies and increases damage to poisoned enemies.</div><div><br></div><div>・Cassandra and Delphi have skills that poison enemies, and Curran, Lathna, and Ieyasu are attack units that can deal great damage against poisoned enemies, so it might be a good idea to build a team with them and challenge co-op quests.</div><div><br></div><div>・Heinwald and Patia&#39;s healing and defense-boosting abilities will also improve, so I believe that putting them in your team after these adjustments should increase users&#39; sense of stability in high-difficulty quests.</div><div><br></div><div>The intention behind these adjustments is to increase shadow-attuned team composition, even if only a little. We&#39;ll continue to make mana spiral adjustments like this on a monthly basis to increase opportunities for using a variety of adventurers.</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks for reading, and thank you for playing Dragalia Lost!</div><div><br></div><div>Yuji Okada</div><div>Director, Dragalia Lost</div>,start_time:1579672800,update_time1579600212
