Five new affinities will be added, and they can be used to activate affinity bonuses that provide resistance to the poison, freeze, blindness, bog, or sleep afflictions. Ability effects provided by affinity bonuses will stack with ability effects provided by wyrmprints but do not share limits.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/6f2c239c2632e2d0eb8a16c4405db259.png"></div><div>The existing wyrmprints listed below will feature one of these new affinities starting in a data update around <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1630044000"></span>.</div><div><br></div><div>・Winds of Saint Lotier</div><div>・Welcome, One and All</div><div>・The Heretic&#39;s Laboratory</div><div>・Destiny&#39;s Hand</div><div>・One with the Shadows</div><div>・Happier Times</div><div>・Kicking Back</div><div>・Egg-Shaped Dreams</div><div>・Treasury of Knowledge</div><div>・Fresh Perspective</div><div>・Fallen Wings</div><div>・To My Dear Child</div><div>・Two Myms</div><div>・The Ilian Faithful</div><div>・Memories of Summer&#39;s Dusk</div><div><br></div><div>To see which new affinity is assigned to which wyrmprint, please check the wyrmprint selection screen accessible when editing teams in-game after the data update around <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1629698400"></span>.

This will not affect certain adventurers with unique victory animations.</div><div><br></div><div>・The behavior of the bleeding debuff will be adjusted. If a player attempts to apply a new stack of bleeding to an enemy when the maximum of three stacks is already applied, the new stack will overwrite the oldest stack with the least potency and lowest duration (so long as the new stack&#39;s potency and duration are greater). This change will make it easier to maintain the damage increase from the maximum of three stacks.</div><div><br></div><div>Notes:</div><div>1. It may take time for the store to reflect the updated information. Players may not be able to perform updates due to their device&#39;s data cache being full.
