By accomplishing these endeavors, you can receive various rewards.</div><div><br></div><div>■Castle Stories</div><div>A new castle story has been added under Castle. You can read castle stories by using looking glasses, which can be obtained as glory rewards.</div><div><br></div><div>■Defensive Event Quests</div><div>Defensive Events feature three kinds of quests: skirmishes, local conflicts, and defensive battles.</div><div>In skirmishes and local conflicts, you simply have to defeat several waves of enemies. There is no gate to defend. Clearing the last wave in the alloted time will result in victory, but failing to do so will result in defeat.</div><div><br></div><div>Defensive Battles are special quests where you are tasked with defending a gate from oncoming enemies. You can clear defensive battles by simply preventing the gate from being destroyed or by losing to the boss, but by defeating the quest&#39;s boss, you will earn additional rewards. If the gate&#39;s HP reaches zero or you are defeated before reaching the boss area, the quest will end in defeat.</div><div><br></div><div>■Gates in Defensive Battles</div><div>You will begin these quests in front of the gate, and its HP will be visible in the upper part of the screen. Your enemies&#39; progress toward reaching it will also be visible in the same portion of the screen. The gate is entirely inanimate, and will not attack enemies.</div><div><br></div><div>■Enemy Routes in Defensive Battles</div><div>When a new group of enemies appears on the map, the route they take will be shown with arrows on the minimap. There are some difficulties where enemy routes will not be displayed.</div><div><br></div><div>■Drawbridges in Defensive Battles</div><div>Some maps will have drawbridges placed on them. Such quests will begin with the drawbridges raised, stopping both enemies and allies from crossing them. By attacking a switch near a drawbridge, you will be able to lower and cross it. Once a drawbridge has been lowered, it cannot be raised again. Enemies will never attack drawbridge switches.</div><div><br></div><div>■Houses and Bandits in Defensive Battles</div><div>Some maps have houses on them. If a map has houses on it, bandits will prioritize attacking the houses over attacking your gate. If you can defeat the bandits before a house is destroyed, a ring of light will appear in front of it. Standing in these rings will give you useful benefits, such as making your adventurers stronger and revealing enemy locations on the minimap. Whether or not houses are destroyed will have no bearing on the rewards you receive at the end of a quest.</div><div><br></div><div>■Boss Enemies in Defensive Battles</div><div>If you defeat all of the enemy waves on a map, you will be able to advance to a new area where a boss enemy is waiting. The boss will not leave the boss area. By defeating the boss within the allocated time, you will receive additional rewards.</div><div><br></div><div>■Retrying in Defensive Battles</div><div>When playing solo, you can retry if your gate reaches 0 HP or if all adventurers in your team reach 0 HP before progressing to the boss area. In co-op, you can only retry if all adventurers reach 0 HP. You cannot retry if your gate reaches 0 HP.</div><div><br></div><div>Notes:</div><div>1.
