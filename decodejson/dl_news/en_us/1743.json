The recent major update brought many changes to the way players craft and upgrade their weapons and introduced the idea of equipping wyrmprints to weapons instead of adventurers. While this system was a lot for many players to take in at first, it seems that new and veteran players alike have come to appreciate the convenience and simplicity that it offers.</div><div><br></div><div>With that said, since you can equip up to five wyrmprints on a single weapon, swapping out weapons can be a hassle since you have to check (or remember) which wyrmprints were equipped on the old weapon before re-equipping them on the new weapon each and every time. Players are hoping for a feature that allows the game to remember which wyrmprints are equipped on a particular weapon or a system that allows them to register sets of wyrmprints to help alleviate some of this back-and-forth busywork.</div><div><br></div><div>What&#39;s more, now that players have to consider not only what combinations of the five available wyrmprints work best but also take wyrmprint affinity bonuses into account as well, they would like to see the addition of more robust searching and sorting tools (perhaps using keywords or a direct-input search) to streamline this process even further.</div><div><br></div><div>Okada: We heard these concerns loud and clear, but unfortunately we did not have enough flexibility in the development schedule to address them in the month of October. We are working toward allowing players to register wyrmprint sets in the near future.</div><div><br></div><div>In addition, we are hard at work considering how to improve the existing sort feature. We would like to implement the ability to sort wyrmprints by affinity bonuses and revise the sort categories to better match the specific effects that wyrmprints possess.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: Players have various requests regarding the Alberian Battle Royale, including a more obvious difference in the amount of battle points earned between different placements, a feature that matches you with your friends or alliance members, and the introduction of rare enemies.</div><div><br></div><div>Okada: We are extremely grateful to see so many players enjoying the Alberian Battle Royale every day. Since this is a mode that pits players against one another, the development team is considering how best to maintain balance going forward based on how players are duking it out. We plan to introduce changes slowly but steadily&mdash;for example, by changing up the dragon that players can transform into during the match. This matters more than you may think!</div><div><br></div><div>Right now, players can only transform into the 4★ dragon Midgardsormr. While he has a strong attack that is certainly useful in a skirmish, what about dragons who can heal or grant buffs? When and why players choose to transform will change depending on the type of dragon that is available to them, thereby shaking up some of the gameplay experience. Of course, we also plan to adjust the rewards and introduce more adventurer skins as time goes on!</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: Regarding rupies, players are grateful for the improvements made to the crafting system in the most recent major update but are concerned that the rupie cost to craft weapons has increased too dramatically. While they understand that some of this increase may be intended to offset the reduction in stamina and getherwing cost for high-difficulty content, some players have found themselves forced to use Gold Fafnirs to boost their rupie intake in every quest that they play, preventing them from making use of other dragons in their roster.</div><div><br></div><div>Okada: First, allow me to apologize&mdash;though we did announce in a previous notification that the rupie cost of certain weapons has increased, we neglected to sufficiently notify players about this change before it was implemented.</div><div><br></div><div>The Version 2.0 update brought with it a whole host of changes to the way the game works as well as the difficulty overall, and the amount of rupies needed to craft weapons was one part of the comprehensive adjustments we made to the gameplay experience. With that said, we fully recognize that rupie costs are much higher now than they were before, and going forward we plan to help players earn more rupies than they could in the past by increasing the frequency of events that reward rupies and rewarding more rupies from events.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: Onto the topic of high-difficulty quests. Veteran players are pleased that the game has been made more accessible to newcomers, but they also want some of that development effort to be dedicated to endgame content that they can really sink their teeth into.</div><div><br></div><div>Some of the older endgame content has been made easier over time in the name of accessibility. For example, in Advanced Dragon Trials, some of High Midgardsormr&#39;s attacks are now indicated by action markers to make them easier to recognize and avoid, and some veteran players hope that quests for the upcoming highest difficulty incorporate few (or none) of these action markers. Some of the most dedicated among us even insist that an endgame battle that can be completed with the auto-play feature is no endgame battle at all!</div><div><br></div><div>Okada: We are designing the latest difficulty of the the Agito Uprising, Legend, to be quite difficult but not impossible to complete in solo play as long your team possesses sufficient might. You may be pleased to hear that co-op will be even tougher. You can expect an experience akin to playing Advanced Dragon Trials on Master difficulty for the very first time, and we&#39;re looking forward to seeing how skilled players rise to the challenge. At the moment, we do not plan to adjust Legend-difficulty quests to become easier as time goes on.</div><div><br></div><div>Clearing these quests will not lead to a large spike in might, but as previously mentioned in the October edition of This Month in Dragalia Lost, players will be able to alter the appearance of their Agito weapons using materials dropped from Legend-difficulty quests, giving them visually appealing effects.</div><div><br></div><div>Players will also be able to earn epithets that indicate to others (in co-op rooms, for example) that they have cleared Legend-difficulty quests.</div><div><br></div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: With the removal of the Mentor Bonus in Version 2.0, some players have found it harder and harder to find others to play certain co-op quests with. Are there any plans to introduce another incentive to encourage co-op play?</div><div><br></div><div>Okada: While I can&#39;t provide any concrete details at the moment, yes, we are actively considering ways to encourage players to make more use of the co-op feature, perhaps by changing the way rooms are displayed or how players are recruited for rooms. We appreciate your patience as we work to find a solution that will address your concerns.</div><div><br></div><hr><div>Director Okada will continue to reply to the feedback players send via Leave Feedback again in the future. We&#39;re looking forward to hearing your comments. (The feedback featured in the next notification will be chosen from feedback received between October 1 and October 31.)</div><div><br></div><div>Thank you for playing Dragalia Lost.</div>,start_time:1604037600,update_time1604022462
