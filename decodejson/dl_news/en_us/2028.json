Should players manage the titanic task of repelling the demonic menace descending upon North Grastaea, they will be rewarded with the ability to equip new wyrmprints to their weapons.</div><div><br></div><div>&quot;If you worms think one mere defeat is enough to put me down for good, then you&#39;re in way over your heads.&quot; When the insatiable desire for revenge gushes forth from the abyss between worlds, a hatred doomed to fester for eternity stains white wings black. A girl eats away at the reasoning once espoused by the angelic herald of the Goddess&#39;s will, fanning the flames of a burning darkness. She is Lilith, the avatar of atrocity masked in a veneer of innocence, and she is evil incarnate, driven to consume all existence on instinct alone.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/c65da2969ecd9bb40a50b510956ddd09.png"></div><div>Required might for Lilith&#39;s Encroaching Shadow: Standard (Shadow): 22,000</div><div>Required might for Lilith&#39;s Encroaching Shadow: Expert (Shadow): 34,000</div><div>Required might for Lilith&#39;s Encroaching Shadow: Master (Shadow/Flame): 36,000</div><div><br></div><div>The quest Lilith&#39;s Encroaching Shadow: Master is only available in solo play, but a co-op play version will be added in early April.</div><div><br></div><div>■How to Unlock</div><div>Players must complete Chapter 16 / 4-6 (Normal) of the main campaign in order to play.</div><div><br></div><div>■New Weapon Slots for Wyrmprints</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/1d8548e157aaef7cae658460cf29c02e.png"></div><div><br></div><div>Players can use the materials obtained from clearing the quest Lilith&#39;s Encroaching Shadow to unlock sixth and seventh wyrmprint slots for their light-attuned Agito weapons.

Be sure that both of your teams are equally ready to take on this challenge!</div><div><br></div><div>Note: Quests with the Team Change mechanic do not reward Adventurer EXP.</div><div><br></div><div>■Weekly Bonuses</div><div>Materials, Fortifying Dragonscales, and Amplifying Dragonscales may be obtained as weekly bonuses for Lilith&#39;s Encroaching Shadow quests.</div><div><br></div><div>Thank you for playing Dragalia Lost.</div><div><br></div>,start_time:1615528800,update_time1616656746
