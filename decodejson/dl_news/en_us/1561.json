The boss will not leave the boss area. By defeating the boss within the allocated time, you will receive additional rewards.</div><div><br></div><div>■Retrying in Defensive Battles</div><div>You can retry if your gate reaches 0 HP or if all adventurers in your team reach 0 HP before progressing to the boss area.</div><div><br></div><div>■Co-op in Defensive Battles</div><div>Defensive battles cannot be played in co-op on the Beginner, Standard, or Expert difficulties.</div><div><br></div><div>Defensive battles can be played in co-op on the Master difficulty.</div><div>・Getherwings are required to play the Defensive Battle: Master quest in co-op.</div><div>・Only stratagems are required to play the Defensive Battle EX quest in co-op.
