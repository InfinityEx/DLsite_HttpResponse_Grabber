Should players manage the titanic task of repelling the demonic menace descending upon North Grastaea, they will be rewarded with the ability to equip new wyrmprints to their weapons!</div><div><br></div><div>He is the embodiment of rent heavens. A calamity of ruin to the world. He engulfs the earth in flame, spreading death with dogged intent. He holds within his form a warped urge to seek destruction. His words are madness. Babble. Twisted, piercing shrieks. He is the disaster that renders all to calx and dross. He is Surtr! And he will not yield his course until all is returned to ash.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/80d60577c55e43ab4baa857af14a0674.png"></div><div><br></div><div>Required might for Surtr&#39;s Devouring Flame: Standard (Flame): 22,000</div><div>Required might for Surtr&#39;s Devouring Flame: Expert (Flame): 34,000</div><div>Required might for Surtr&#39;s Devouring Flame: Master (Flame/Light): 36,000</div><div><br></div><div>■How to Unlock</div><div>Players must complete Chapter 16 / 4-6 (Normal) of the main campaign in order to play.</div><div><br></div><div>■New Weapon Slots</div><div>Players can use the materials obtained from clearing the quest Surtr&#39;s Devouring Flame to unlock sixth and seventh wyrmprint slots for their water-attuned Agito weapons.

When this occurs, players must adapt to this new threat by changing their team, and therefore must prepare two teams of predetermined elemental attunements before embarking on the quest. Be sure that both of your teams are equally ready to take on this challenge!</div><div><br></div><div>Note: Quests with the Team Change mechanic do not reward Adventurer EXP.</div><div><br></div><div>Thank you for playing Dragalia Lost.</div>,start_time:1635487200,update_time1634024076
