The difference between a regular Tenfold Summon and the Platinum Showcase is that a 5★ adventurer, wyrmprint, or dragon is guaranteed to appear. Whether you get an adventurer, a wyrmprint, or a dragon depends on when you do your summon.</div><div><br></div><div>There are defined periods for the 5★ Adventurer Guaranteed, the 5★ Wyrmprint Guaranteed, and the 5★ Dragon Guaranteed summons. During each period, players are limited to doing the Platinum Showcase summon only once, and these summons can only be performed with diamantium (purchase required).</div><div><br></div><div>Platinum Showcase durations:</div><div>・5★ Adventurer Guaranteed:</div><div><span class="local_date" data-local_date="1542866400"></span> to <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1543125540"></span></div><div>・5★ Wyrmprint Guaranteed:</div><div><span class="local_date" data-local_date="1543125600"></span> to <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1543384740"></span></div><div>・5★ Dragon Guaranteed:</div><div><span class="local_date" data-local_date="1543384800"></span> to <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1543643940"></span></div><div><br></div><div>Notes:</div><div>1.
