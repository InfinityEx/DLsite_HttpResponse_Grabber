Rewards from the daily bonus are obtained automatically when earned.<br><br>Note that the daily bonus for Trials of the Mighty differs from the traditional daily bonus in that players may stock multiple unearned bonuses. This stock grows incrementally by one every day at 07:00 (up to a maximum of three).<br><br>Daily bonus rewards depend on the quest difficulty and are as follows:<br><br>\\u30fbStandard: Eligible adventurer&#39;s Conviction &times; 1, Nature&#39;s Blessing &times; 1, Fortifying Dragonscale &times; 2, Amplifying Dragonscale &times; 2<br>\\u30fbExpert: Eligible adventurer&#39;s Conviction &times; 2, eligible adventurer&#39;s Devotion &times; 1, Nature&#39;s Blessing &times; 1, Fortifying Dragonscale &times; 2, Amplifying Dragonscale &times; 2<br>\\u30fbMaster: Eligible adventurer&#39;s Conviction &times; 2, eligible adventurer&#39;s Devotion &times; 1, Nature&#39;s Blessing &times; 2, Fortifying Dragonscale &times; 3, Amplifying Dragonscale &times; 3<br><br>The reward from each daily bonus depends on the boss who was defeated when it is earned. For example, if you stock a daily bonus while Thor&#39;s Trial is available, then earn it while Poseidon&#39;s Trial is available, you will earn the rewards from Poseidon&#39;s Trial, not Thor&#39;s Trial.<br><br>Note: Players must have completed up to Chapter 10 \/ 6-3 (Normal) of the main campaign to participate.<br><br>Thank you for playing Dragalia Lost.<\/div>","start_time":1618380000,"prev_article_id":"2115","next_article_id":"30105","image_path":"https:\/\/dragalialost.akamaized.net\/attached\/information\/images\/e3feafd9615f9e914c5a00e4639ba0a9.png","update_time":1618368589}}}'
