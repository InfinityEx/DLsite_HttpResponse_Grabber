Yuji Okada here, director of Dragalia Lost.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>I wanted to provide a brief explanation about the intention behind the adjustments to adventurers with mana spirals.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>\\u30fbIn January, more 5\\u2605 adventurers will be able to unlock the mana spiral, but we&#39;re planning on unlocking the mana spiral for 3\\u2605 and 4\\u2605 shadow-attuned adventurers in February, so please wait just a little longer for that.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>\\u30fbSpeaking of shadow-attuned adventurers with the mana spiral unlocked, it&#39;s already unlocked for Cassandra and Ieyasu, but with the adventurers being added this time, you&#39;ll be able to create a team that poisons enemies and increases damage to poisoned enemies.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>\\u30fbCassandra and Delphi have skills that poison enemies, and Curran, Lathna, and Ieyasu are attack units that can deal great damage against poisoned enemies, so it might be a good idea to build a team with them and challenge co-op quests.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>\\u30fbHeinwald and Patia&#39;s healing and defense-boosting abilities will also improve, so I believe that putting them in your team after these adjustments should increase users&#39; sense of stability in high-difficulty quests.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>The intention behind these adjustments is to increase shadow-attuned team composition, even if only a little. We&#39;ll continue to make mana spiral adjustments like this on a monthly basis to increase opportunities for using a variety of adventurers.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>Thanks for reading, and thank you for playing Dragalia Lost!<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>Yuji Okada<\/div><div>Director, Dragalia Lost<\/div>","start_time":1579672800,"prev_article_id":"1034","next_article_id":"1024","image_path":"","update_time":1579600212}}}'
