To maintain the balance of current and future Legend-difficulty quests, we have decided that the flame attunement requirement for Volk&#39;s Wrath: Legend will also apply to dragons starting with the version update at the end of January 2021. (Players may still challenge these quests even if no dragons are equipped.) Weapons, shared skills, and helper skills will continue to be unaffected by these restrictions.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>We apologize for any inconvenience caused by the failure to restrict dragon elemental attunements from the release of Volk&#39;s Wrath: Legend that necessitated this change.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>\\u25a0Details<\/div><div>\\u30fbIn the Volk&#39;s Wrath: Legend quest, the elemental attunement restriction will apply not only to adventurers but to dragons as well.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>Along with this change, the dragons in the Preferred Team history for Volk&#39;s Wrath: Legend will be reset after the version update at the end of January 2021.
