The Shapeshift button can only be toggled on while auto-play is enabled and is also available when using auto-repeat.<\/div><div><img src=\\"https:\/\/dragalialost.akamaized.net\/attached\/information\/images\/b825a591df6d07e3238b85555231eba5.png\\"><\/div><div><br><\/div><div><br><\/div><div>\\u25bcNew Feature: Equipment Sets<\/div><div>When editing a team, players can register individual equipment sets that determine which weapon, dragon, and wyrmprints an adventurer will equip. Once registered, a set can be applied to a particular adventurer to have them automatically equip the specified loadout.<\/div><div><img src=\\"https:\/\/dragalialost.akamaized.net\/attached\/information\/images\/8f383e8d5b25197e21cccb055f34af22.png\\"><\/div><div><br><\/div><div><br><\/div><div>\\u25bcNew Feature: Team Copy<\/div><div>Players can duplicate their team setups and overwrite existing setups with copied ones.<\/div><div><img src=\\"https:\/\/dragalialost.akamaized.net\/attached\/information\/images\/dbdac0e14171457b97aef7cba156a7d8.png\\"><\/div><div><br><\/div><div>\\u25bcNew High-Difficulty Quest: Rise of the Sinister Dominion<\/div><div>A new series of high-difficulty quests, Rise of the Sinister Dominion, arrives <span class=\\"local_date\\" data-local_date=\\"1614924000\\"><\/span>. In certain difficulties of these quests, the player&#39;s current team will be swapped out mid-battle with another one, so they must prepare two teams of differing elemental attunements beforehand. Drop rewards include wyrmprints that can be equipped in new slots on weapons and the materials required to unbind and add copies of those wyrmprints. Players must complete Chapter 16 \/ 4-6 (Normal) of the main campaign, Setting Off, in order to play. Further details will be provided in a separate notification.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>\\u25bcUpdated System: Wyrmprints<\/div><div>With the addition of the first Rise of the Sinister Dominion quest, arriving <span class=\\"local_date\\" data-local_date=\\"1614924000\\"><\/span>, special slots in weapons, and wyrmprints that can only be equipped in those slots, will become available. Depending on the weapon, up to two of these wyrmprints may be equipped, and the slots for them may be unlocked using materials that drop from Rise of the Sinister Dominion quests. Affinities from these new wyrmprints will count toward affinity bonuses in the same manner as those from existing wyrmprints.<\/div><div><img src=\\"https:\/\/dragalialost.akamaized.net\/attached\/information\/images\/59cf82f22584b91579d2aaeb0e06bcfd.png\\"><\/div><div><br><\/div><div>Wyrmprints that may be equipped in these new slots are different from existing wyrmprints in that, in addition to holy water and consecrated water, they can also be upgraded using special items that drop in place of duplicated wyrmprints. These wyrmprints may be unbound and copies may be added with said special items as well as materials that drop from Rise of the Sinister Dominion. However, they may not be unbound with silver keys or golden keys.<\/div><div><img src=\\"https:\/\/dragalialost.akamaized.net\/attached\/information\/images\/b16df9dbd6c94b4d560fb873cecb249e.png\\"><\/div><div><br><\/div><div>\\u25bcNew Mechanic: Overdrive Counter<\/div><div>A new mechanic, the overdrive counter, will appear in Rise of the Sinister Dominion quests. When (and only when) an enemy in the overdrive state attacks with a red action marker, players can reduce that enemy&#39;s overdrive mode gauge by an amount greater than normal if they use an attack skill to inflict damage (in other words, counter). We plan to include this mechanic in more quests in the future.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div><span style=\\"color: rgb(41, 105, 176);\\"><strong>[Addendum <span class=\\"local_date\\" data-local_date=\\"1615543800\\"><\/span>]<\/strong><\/span><br>An overdrive counter is triggered by using an attack skill with the right timing against an enemy attack that can be countered by this mechanic. Enemy attacks that can be countered by this mechanic are indicated with an icon. If an overdrive counter is successfully executed, the text &quot;OVERDRIVE COUNTER&quot; will appear on screen.<\/div><div><img src=\\"https:\/\/dragalialost.akamaized.net\/attached\/information\/images\/f7f6a63c40456685888c44dbab8b8282.png\\"><\/div><div><br><\/div><div>\\u25a0Other Changes<\/div><div>\\u30fbThe logic that determines how AI-controlled adventurers dodge certain action markers will be adjusted.<\/div><div>\\u30fbThe dragon Gala Reborn Poseidon&#39;s abilities (Water) Fury of the Seas I and (Water) Fury of the Seas II will be adjusted to also affect enemies with no elemental attunement.<\/div><div>\\u30fbThe dragon Gala Reborn Zephyr&#39;s abilities (Wind) Wrath of the Plains I and (Wind) Wrath of the Plains II will be adjusted so that they also affect enemies with no elemental attunement.<\/div><div>\\u30fbAdventurers wielding rapid-fire manacasters will be able to move while performing their force strike.<\/div><div>\\u30fbIf auto-play is enabled and both the skill Hound Shot and Ace Operator are available for the adventurer Formal Joachim to use, he will use Ace Operator first and Hound Shot directly afterward.<\/div><div>\\u30fbThe appearance of certain objects in quests will be adjusted.<\/div><div>\\u30fbThe user interface will be adjusted in various places.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>\\u25a0Issues Addressed<\/div><div>\\u30fbWhile playing Tartarus&#39;s Wrath on Standard, Expert, or Master difficulties, when the adventurer Dragonyule Lily performs an upgraded force strike after being granted the Saint Starfall Lily effect, if the team member that is most in need of healing is in a portal zone, their HP may not be restored and their max HP may not be increased.<\/div><div>\\u30fbCertain normal endeavors for Advanced Dragon Trials and The Agito Uprising are able to be completed despite their names appearing as &quot;???.&quot;<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>Notes:<\/div><div>1.
