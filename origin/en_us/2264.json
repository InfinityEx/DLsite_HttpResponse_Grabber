Due to this issue, the game may prevent players from automatically unlocking a co-ability node even though they have enough eldwater to do so manually.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>\\u30fbWhile the Display Preference for Mana Circles is set to &quot;3D,&quot; if the player uses the Auto Unlock, Auto Unlock (To Selected Circle), or Auto Unlock (To Selected Node) features to unlock an Unbind node, taps on the node, then taps &quot;Unbind,&quot; the game will freeze.<br>Note: This issue does not occur if the Display Preference for Mana Circles is set to &quot;2D.&quot;<br><br>\\u30fbIf the Auto Unlock feature is used to unlock one or more mana circles under certain conditions, the unlock process may stop partway through.

Fully unbinding a dragon whose encyclopedia bonus you have already unlocked does not unlock the bonus again.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>As a result of addressing this issue, the pop-up that leads to Notte&#39;s Notes after fully unbinding a dragon will be disabled until the next update.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>\\u25a0Note<\/div><div>It may take time for the store to reflect the updated information.
