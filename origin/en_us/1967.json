It is up to each player to choose which of the four weapons to craft.<\/div><div>\\u30fbGifts can be claimed from your goodie box for up to seven days after logging in. If a gift isn&#39;t retrieved within seven days, it will be lost.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>\\u25a0How to Craft Chimeratech Weapons<\/div><div>Crafting a particular Chimeratech weapon requires a specific non-elemental core weapon and Smithy level. The core weapon series serves as the baseline set of weaponry in Dragalia Lost, and materials for crafting and upgrading them are available from various quests throughout the game. The Chimeratech weapon series is more powerful than the core weapon series but requires materials that can normally only be obtained by defeating the elementally attuned chimera bosses in Void Battles.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>First, craft a 4\\u2605 non-elemental core weapon after fully upgrading a 3\\u2605 non-elemental core weapon (requires Smithy Lv. 4+). Then, craft a 5\\u2605 non-elemental core weapon after fully upgrading a 4\\u2605 non-elemental core weapon (requires Smithy Lv. 5+). <span style=\\"color: rgb(226, 80, 65);\\">Finally, craft a Chimeratech weapon after fully upgrading a 5\\u2605 non-elemental core weapon (requires Smithy Lv. 8+).<\/span><\/div><div><br><\/div><div>For example, to craft the flame-attuned sword Chimeratech Commander, craft Knights&#39; Grace after fully upgrading Knight&#39;s Sword, craft Hero&#39;s Sword after fully upgrading Knights&#39; Grace, then craft Chimeratech Commander after fully upgrading Hero&#39;s Sword.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>Notes:<\/div><div>\\u30fbA &quot;fully upgraded&quot; weapon is one that has had its stat and functionality upgrade nodes fully unlocked.<\/div><div>\\u30fbThere are no 3\\u2605 non-elemental manacasters. Players can craft a 4\\u2605 non-elemental manacaster if their Smithy is Lv. 4 or higher.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>\\u25a0Level Up Your Smithy!<\/div><div>As mentioned in the previous section, certain weapons cannot be crafted until your Smithy facility reaches the required level, so it&#39;s important to build the Smithy in your Halidom and level it up as you progress through the game. Note that certain Smithy level upgrades require that your Halidom be a specific level before you can perform them, so don&#39;t forget to keep your Halidom level up-to-date as well.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>Players who use the main campaign skip feature to skip chapters one through ten will have their Smithy upgraded to Lv. 6 automatically.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div><img src=\\"https:\/\/dragalialost.akamaized.net\/attached\/information\/images\/3ba5499b35fc83f08b18b7511718454c.png\\" style=\\"width: 300px; height: 521px;\\"><\/div><div><br><\/div><div><img src=\\"https:\/\/dragalialost.akamaized.net\/attached\/information\/images\/a860e5f1293acbf56bf91c3221795628.png\\" style=\\"width: 300px; height: 521px;\\"><\/div><div><br><\/div><div><img src=\\"https:\/\/dragalialost.akamaized.net\/attached\/information\/images\/ea0719d79e4dfe73372aeac7594ddfd4.png\\" style=\\"width: 300px; height: 521px;\\"><\/div><div><br><\/div><div>\\u25a0Crafting Weapons<\/div><div>To craft a weapon, tap Upgrade at the bottom of the screen, tap Weapons\/Crafting, select the series of weapon, then tap on the weapon that you wish to craft.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div><img src=\\"https:\/\/dragalialost.akamaized.net\/attached\/information\/images\/6dded7f62ca4528fe96afbab004b8724.png\\" style=\\"width: 300px; height: 521px;\\"><\/div><div><br><\/div><div><img src=\\"https:\/\/dragalialost.akamaized.net\/attached\/information\/images\/4c58ba13ed527e5e65ed4d12e7788153.png\\" style=\\"width: 300px; height: 521px;\\"><\/div><div><br><\/div><div>\\u25a0Upgrading Weapons<\/div><div>To upgrade a weapon, tap Upgrade at the bottom of the screen, tap Weapons\/Crafting, select the series of weapon, then tap on the weapon that you wish to upgrade.
