The difference between a regular Tenfold Summon and the Platinum Showcase is that a 5\\u2605 adventurer, wyrmprint, or dragon is guaranteed to appear. Whether you get an adventurer, a wyrmprint, or a dragon depends on when you do your summon.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>There are defined periods for the 5\\u2605 Adventurer Guaranteed, the 5\\u2605 Wyrmprint Guaranteed, and the 5\\u2605 Dragon Guaranteed summons. During each period, players are limited to doing the Platinum Showcase summon only once, and these summons can only be performed with diamantium (purchase required).<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>Platinum Showcase durations:<\/div><div>\\u30fb5\\u2605 Adventurer Guaranteed:<\/div><div><span class=\\"local_date\\" data-local_date=\\"1542866400\\"><\/span> to <span class=\\"local_date\\" data-local_date=\\"1543125540\\"><\/span><\/div><div>\\u30fb5\\u2605 Wyrmprint Guaranteed:<\/div><div><span class=\\"local_date\\" data-local_date=\\"1543125600\\"><\/span> to <span class=\\"local_date\\" data-local_date=\\"1543384740\\"><\/span><\/div><div>\\u30fb5\\u2605 Dragon Guaranteed:<\/div><div><span class=\\"local_date\\" data-local_date=\\"1543384800\\"><\/span> to <span class=\\"local_date\\" data-local_date=\\"1543643940\\"><\/span><\/div><div><br><\/div><div>Notes:<\/div><div>1.
