This voucher allows you to summon one adventurer or dragon of your choice who appeared in the game between its release and May of 2020 (excluding those who appeared in Gala Dragalia or for a limited time only). Note that we do not plan on making this voucher obtainable after the event is over, so be sure to grab it while you can!</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/914d52cff9aa24b7693f9181e642fbc5.png"></div><div>Fans of the Japanese voice lines may be interested to know that this event&#39;s theme song, Sample Answer, was sung by none other than Grimnir&#39;s voice actor, Megumi Ogata.</div><div><br></div><div>Vania and Gala Reborn Agni appear in a Gala Dragalia that began on <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1619589600"></span>.

Unlike the trials last month, you can earn materials for both Gala and non-Gala adventurers this month.</div><div><br></div><div>・A defensive event that features the adventurer Saiga, whom you may remember from his brief introduction in the most recent episode of Dragalia Digest, will start on <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1620626400"></span>. He will be joined by an existing adventurer in a new, heavily armored outfit. I hope you&#39;re looking forward to learning more about Saiga and his past when the event becomes available!</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/6e0964603d76415286b02d65cf44b8a9.png"></div><div><br></div><div>・The Agents of the Goddess facility event will return on <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1621231200"></span>. Be sure to construct the facility that boosts the HP and strength of adventurers who wield axes or staffs.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/1c727c549f8a1ecc64926aed2044e71f.png"></div><div><br></div><div>・The Fire Emblem: Lost Heroes and Fire Emblem: Kindred Ties events will be added to the Event Compendium on <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1621231200"></span>.

Although it can only be used to see the top-performing teams in solo quests at the moment, we plan to expand its functionality to co-op quests in the future.</div><div><br></div><div>・In the next update, we plan to reduce the number of daily bonuses for Dragon Trials and The Imperial Onslaught to one, but increase the amount of rewards that you earn from each. We recently reduced the stamina cost of many quests, and we hope that both of these changes will make it easier for players to tackle the ever-growing amount of content in a timely manner.</div><div><br></div><div>・We will add a new feature to Notte&#39;s Notes called &quot;medals.&quot; These medals will be awarded to individual adventurers each time they clear quests like Advanced Dragon Trials, The Agito Uprising, and Rise of the Sinister Dominion. Although these medals will not provide any stat bonuses, we hope that players will enjoy seeing another tangible measure of their roster&#39;s development. Perhaps you&#39;d like to challenge yourself to earn a certain amount of medals with a specific adventurer, or even with all of your adventurers? The choice is yours.</div><div><br></div><div>・In the next update, we plan to add the previously announced features that allow you to automatically unlock up to a specific mana node or even all five of an adventurer&#39;s mana circles at once and view and upgrade all of your facilities from a single screen.</div><div><br></div><div>■In Conclusion</div><div>Thank you for reading this month&#39;s update. We&#39;re giving all players the following gift this month.</div><div><br></div><div>・Champion&#39;s Testament &times; 2</div><div>・Sunlight Ore &times; 3</div><div><br></div><div>The next installment of This Month in Dragalia Lost will be posted around <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1622527200"></span>. Until then, thanks for reading and for continuing to play Dragalia Lost!</div><div><br></div><div>Yuji Okada</div><div>Director, Dragalia Lost</div><div><br></div><div>Notes:</div><div>・The gift can be claimed from your goodie box for up to seven days after reception.
