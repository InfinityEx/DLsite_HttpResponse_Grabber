message:<div>Hello, everyone! Yuji Okada here, director of Dragalia Lost.</div><div><br></div><div>First off, as always, thank you for playing Dragalia Lost. I&#39;m again excited to bring you the latest news on what&#39;s happening in and around the game this month.</div><div><br></div><div>■The Invasion Event The Blood That Binds Is Here!</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/d09c7e92bd273c5fed8630d893457dad.png"></div><div><br></div><div>How are you enjoying the latest invasion event? With Valyx and Phares making their event debuts, fans of the Alberian royal family will surely find a lot to like as the scions work together to overcome their shared struggle.</div><div><br></div><div>If you&#39;re wondering why Phares is making an appearance now, all will become clear in the latest chapter of the main campaign, so be sure to stay up to date. The more familiar you are with the plot of the main campaign, the more you can enjoy the developments in this event, so I hope that you will spend some time with both to get the most enjoyment out of the game&#39;s overarching story.</div><div><br></div><div>Dragalia Lost&#39;s story began with the seven scions splintered, but since then we have seen everything from cooperation to competition as they followed their own paths, grew more confident in both themselves and each other, and remade the very world as they know it with their actions. In this new spirit of camaraderie, I hope that someday Beren and his siblings will be able to reconcile their differences...</div><div><br></div><div>Speaking of reconciling differences, the adventurer Gala Emile, who played a major role in part two of chapter 23 of the main campaign, is featured in a Gala Dragalia available now. Though he often felt like he was living in the shadow of his siblings, he has finally found his own unique way to stand tall and rule. Check out how far this prodigal son has come by playing the main campaign and reading his adventurer story.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/dbe752c41143e3da0754e48c135c68f7.png"></div><div><br></div><div>■Plans for This Month</div><div>・The adventurers Valyx and Phares and the dragon Michael will appear in a Prize Showcase starting on <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1643954400"></span>.
