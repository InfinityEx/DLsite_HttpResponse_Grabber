As they hotfoot it our way, my brother-in-law, Saiga, shows his ugly mug. He claims they&#39;re lookin&#39; for a gee-gaw from my grandpappy and asks me to hand it over.

Enemy attacks will get fiercer with each increase in difficulty level. What&#39;s more, in the Defensive Battle quests, which are the final quests for each difficulty level, you can enjoy battles that combine attacking and defending where you must defend your gate while repelling enemies advancing from various routes. Use your full might to repel the walking dead and win peace for New Alberia!</div><div><br></div><div>Note: We will add various types of maps for Defensive Battles in future events.</div><div><br></div><div>■Rewards</div><div>You can get wind tomes and flame tomes, which can be used to unlock the shared skills of wind- and flame-attuned adventurers, as glory rewards in this event.</div><div><br></div><div>■Event Duration</div><div><span class="local_date" data-local_date="1620626400"></span> to <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1621403999"></span></div><div><br></div><div>■Reward Availability Period</div><div><span class="local_date" data-local_date="1620626400"></span> to <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1622008799"></span></div><div><br></div><div>■Story</div><div>In this event, you can enjoy a new story about allies defending against enemies with all of their might.

At the start of the event, only one beginner quest will be unlocked. More quests can be unlocked using items that are unique to the event. After clearing all of the quests for a difficulty, you will receive a Victory Reward and the next difficulty will be unlocked.</div><div><br></div><div>■Glory</div><div>Glory points are event-exclusive points that can be earned by clearing event quests. Collect them to earn all kinds of rewards such as limited-time items that can be used to unlock event-exclusive quests and stories.</div><div><br></div><div>■Limited-Time Items</div><div>These are limited-time items that you can obtain by collecting glory points. They can be used to unlock event quests and stories. Limited-time items are reset for each event. Battle charts are items that are used to unlock quests. Stratagems are items that are used to challenge the EX quest. War chronicles are items that are used to unlock stories.</div><div><br></div><div>Battle charts can be obtained by collecting glory in this event. They cannot be obtained as drop rewards, as endeavor completion rewards, or from the Treasure Trade.</div><div><br></div><div>■Treasure Trade</div><div>You can earn primal crystals by playing event quests and trade them for various rewards on the Treasure Trade menu.</div><div><br></div><div>■Endeavors</div><div>These endeavors can only be attempted for the duration of the event. They are separated into Daily and Limited variations. By accomplishing these endeavors, you can receive various rewards.</div><div><br></div><div>■Castle Stories</div><div>You can read castle stories by using looking glasses, which can be obtained as glory rewards.</div><div><br></div><div>Note: No new castle stories will be added during this event.</div><div><br></div><div>■Defensive Event Quests</div><div>Defensive Events feature three kinds of quests: skirmishes, local conflicts, and defensive battles. In skirmishes and local conflicts, you simply have to defeat several waves of enemies. There is no gate to defend. Clearing the last wave in the alloted time will result in victory, but failing to do so will result in defeat.</div><div><br></div><div>Defensive Battles are special quests where you are tasked with defending a gate from oncoming enemies. You can clear defensive battles by simply preventing the gate from being destroyed or by losing to the boss, but by defeating the quest&#39;s boss, you will earn additional rewards. If the gate&#39;s HP reaches zero or you are defeated before reaching the boss area, the quest will end in defeat.</div><div><br></div><div>■Gates in Defensive Battles</div><div>You will begin these quests in front of the gate, and its HP will be visible in the upper part of the screen. Your enemies&#39; progress toward reaching it will also be visible in the same portion of the screen. The gate is entirely inanimate, and will not attack enemies.</div><div><br></div><div>■Enemy Routes in Defensive Battles</div><div>When a new group of enemies appears on the map, the route they take will be shown with arrows on the minimap. There are some difficulties where enemy routes will not be displayed.</div><div><br></div><div>■Quest Skills</div><div>These are special skills that can be activated during certain quests. Once activated, their effects will originate at the location of the controlled adventurer. They can be used up to three times per quest and incur a cooldown upon use during which they cannot be activated again. Quest skills may be unavailable in certain quests.</div><div><br></div><div>■Drawbridges in Defensive Battles</div><div>Some maps will have drawbridges placed on them. Such quests will begin with the drawbridges raised, stopping both enemies and allies from crossing them. By attacking a switch near a drawbridge, you will be able to lower and cross it. Once a drawbridge has been lowered, it cannot be raised again. Enemies will never attack drawbridge switches.</div><div><br></div><div>■Houses and Bandits in Defensive Battles</div><div>Some maps have houses on them. If a map has houses on it, bandits will prioritize attacking the houses over attacking your gate. If you can defeat the bandits before a house is destroyed, a ring of light will appear in front of it. Standing in these rings will give you useful benefits, such as making your adventurers stronger and revealing enemy locations on the minimap. Whether or not houses are destroyed will have no bearing on the rewards you receive at the end of a quest.</div><div><br></div><div>■Boss Enemies in Defensive Battles</div><div>If you defeat all of the enemy waves on a map, you will be able to advance to a new area where a boss enemy is waiting. The boss will not leave the boss area. By defeating the boss within the allocated time, you will receive additional rewards.</div><div><br></div><div>■Retrying in Defensive Battles</div><div>You can retry if your gate reaches 0 HP or if all adventurers in your team reach 0 HP before progressing to the boss area.</div><div><br></div><div>■Co-op in Defensive Battles</div><div>Defensive battles cannot be played in co-op on the Beginner, Standard, or Expert difficulties. Defensive battles can be played in co-op on the Master difficulty. Getherwings are required to play the Defensive Battle: Master quest in co-op. Only stratagems are required to play the Defensive Battle EX and Defensive Battle: Field Training Exercise quests in co-op. Getherwings are not required.</div><div><br></div><div>Notes:</div><div>1.
