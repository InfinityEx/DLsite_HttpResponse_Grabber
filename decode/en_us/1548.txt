message:<div>Hello! Yuji Okada here, director of Dragalia Lost.</div><div><br></div><div>I want to start by thanking you for playing Dragalia Lost.</div><div><br></div><div>The Agents of the Goddess facility event is now live. The Ilian Church of northern Grastaea is home to apostles who play a central role in how the event unfolds. By participating, you&#39;ll be able to construct a facility that boosts the HP and strength of adventurers who wield axes or staffs.</div><div><br></div><div>The theme song, CHECKMATE feat. EMA, was created by WEAKEND WALKER.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/1c727c549f8a1ecc64926aed2044e71f.png"></div><div><br></div><div>The shadow-attuned boss Tartarus has made an appearance in The Agito Uprising. You can also craft 6★ light-attuned weapons now, so be sure to try taking him on!</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/c041e5b9de604173232cace0825e3640.png"></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Nevin, Pinon, and Ramiel (the adventurers and dragon who appear in the Agents of the Goddess event) have made an appearance in Gala Dragalia alongside Valyx&#39;s pactbound dragon Gala Thor, who boasts impressively strong standard attacks.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/fe42c06b84bc4a653dd05867783a537d.png"></div><div><br></div><div>■Plans for This Month</div><div>・Mana spirals for the light-attuned adventurers Estelle, Luca, and Lucretia will be unlocked on September 2.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/db5349880999c107454dceb82107d96b.png"></div><div><br></div><div>・A defensive event will be held in mid-September.</div><div><br></div><div>A certain pair will play a big role, and the story will focus on the secrets of their origins.</div><div><br></div><div>You&#39;ll be able to use the auto-play feature on Beginner, Standard, and Expert difficulties to play through maps that are designed to be played without much hassle.</div><div><br></div><div>Also, starting with this event, Japanese voices will be added for defensive events. The story in onslaught events and defensive events is a bit different from the story in the main campaign, raid events, and facility events, so I&#39;m hopeful that the addition of voiced dialogue will draw players even further into the game&#39;s storytelling.</div><div><br></div><div>・A revival of the Fractured Futures raid event will be held in late September.</div><div>This event debuted last year as part of the first anniversary celebration. Now that it&#39;s coming back, you&#39;ll have a chance to add the event-exclusive adventurer Audric and dragon Parallel Zodiark to your team if you haven&#39;t already.</div><div><br></div><div>This event provides a close look into the heart of the Dragalia Lost story and setting, so I hope those of you who haven&#39;t experienced it yet will take this opportunity to do so.</div><div><br></div><div>・An interlude will be added to chapter 15 of the main campaign in late September.</div><div><br></div><div>・Master difficulty for Ciella, the water-attuned boss of The Agito Uprising, will be added in early October. I hope you&#39;re looking forward to testing your strength!</div><div><br></div><div>・Dragalia Lost will celebrate its second anniversary on September 27.</div><div>Like the first anniversary, the second will feature a variety of celebratory events, including a raid event related to the main campaign. Playing through the recently added chapter 15 will ensure that you&#39;re caught up on the latest story beats and can enjoy this event to the fullest. We&#39;re working on more than just the story, though: look forward to going up against an all-new raid boss too!</div><div><br></div><div>■Future Updates<br>・Since the next update will be released during the second anniversary, we plan to implement a variety of adjustments to existing features and add new ones while addressing game balance.<br><br>・Included in these changes will be large-scale adjustments to the balance of adventurers, dragons, and weapons.<br><br>At the moment, the damage output and skill performance of shadow-attuned adventurers is stronger than those of other elements, leading players to prioritize their inclusion in teams regardless of whether or not shadow has the elemental advantage in a particular quest. While we don&#39;t feel that damage output and skill performance need to be completely equal across all five elements, we recognize that shadow-attuned adventurers are noticeably stronger than their counterparts at this time.<br><br>To address this imbalance, we plan to adjust the other four elements so they perform at a similarly high standard. We may have to adjust the strength of enemies alongside these changes, but we&#39;ll take care not to alter the current gameplay experience too much. These balance adjustments will be implemented in an update in late September.<br><br>・The weapon system will be made easier to understand in the next update.<br><br>Currently, there are lots of weapons players can craft, and figuring out which ones to make can be confusing. Players also obtain weapons as rewards, but often there is not enough space for them. Players could dismantle those weapons, but that can be a frustration as well. In the next update, we&#39;ll adjust the way weapons are obtained and upgraded with the aim of alleviating the above concerns. Since this will be a large departure from the current system, we&#39;ll provide further details in a notification before the update is released.<br><br>・In addition to what I&#39;ve covered here, we plan to include further gameplay improvements and enhancements in the next update and will release a Dragalia Digest in late September with more information.<br><br>■In Conclusion<br>We&#39;re giving all players the following items this month.<br><br>・Summon Voucher x3</div><div>・Blessed Ethon Ashes x5</div><div>・Quality Honey x10</div><div><br><br>The next installment of This Month in Dragalia Lost will be posted around October 1, 2020.<br><br>Until then, thanks for reading, and for continuing to play Dragalia Lost!<br><br>Yuji Okada<br>Director, Dragalia Lost<br><br>Notes:<br>・The gift can be claimed from your goodie box for up to seven days after reception. If the gift isn&#39;t retrieved within seven days, it will be lost.<br>・Summon showcase, event, and update content may change without notice.<br>・Any adventurers and game screenshots shown are still in development.</div>
