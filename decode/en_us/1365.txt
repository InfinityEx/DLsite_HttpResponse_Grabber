message:<div>Hello! Yuji Okada here, director of Dragalia Lost.</div><div><br></div><div>I want to start by thanking you for playing Dragalia Lost.</div><div><br></div><div>■Timeworn Torment</div><div>The Timeworn Torment raid event is currently live.</div><div><br></div><div>You can increase friendship with the light-attuned 5★ adventurer who appears in the event, Wu Kong, by adding him to your team during the event and clearing quests. If you maximize your friendship, he&#39;ll permanently join your roster.</div><div><br></div><div>You can use items called Wu Kong&#39;s Conviction, which can be obtained during the event, to unlock his mana nodes and unbind his mana circles. Furthermore, in addition to dealing extra damage in event quests during the event, he also takes reduced damage. Collect raid boosts, upgrade Wu Kong, and try to clear Omega difficulty!</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/af0a8d658ad3a93021f7c6ff44b061dc.png"></div><div><br></div><div>The Omega Level 2 (Raid) difficulty, which was added in the previous raid event revival, Loyalty&#39;s Requiem, is in this event as well. Omega Level 2 (Raid) does not have any special rewards, but it does provide a challenge, so using the high dragon weapons or Agito weapons is recommended. If you&#39;re confident in your skills, try taking on this quest!</div><div><br></div><div>Also, the theme song for this event, Force Your Way, was composed by Keisuke Okada and sung by Takayoshi Tanimoto. It plays during the story and raid boss battles. I think it&#39;s a pretty cool song, so please give it a listen.</div><div><br></div><div>■Gala Dragalia</div><div>A Gala Dragalia is live now.</div><div>In addition to Gala Leif, the new dragon Tie Shan Gongzhu, and adventurers Radiant Xuan Zang, Zhu Bajie, and Sha Wujing, who appear in the current event, have also been added to the summon showcase.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/a7a23c2815808ea044980e7eacec3fe9.png"></div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/69c65331d39cb472e5d7d2303db38957.png"></div><div>Starting with the current summon showcase, new non-Gala adventurers and dragons will also appear in Gala Dragalia.</div><div><br></div><div>Gala Leif will only appear during Gala Dragalia, but Radiant Xuan Zang, Zhu Bajie, Sha Wujing, and Tie Shan Gongzhu will continue to appear in future summon showcases. Also, Gala Dragalia was previously only available once every two months, but going forward they&#39;ll be held at irregular intervals.</div><div><br></div><div>■Version 1.20.0</div><div>Version 1.20.0 was recently released.</div><div><br></div><div>Regarding the shared skill feature added in version 1.20.0, there are some skills that can be set as shared skills, and others that cannot. This information can be found on the adventurer details screen and in the showcase information.</div><div><br></div><div>Skills set as shared skills are subject to some changes, such as damage dealt, amount of HP recovered, and the skill gauge requirements for using the skills. Though it varies from skill to skill, the skill gauge requirements can be quite different, with some skills requiring twice the original gauge, or more, to use. There are also several requirements for sharing skills, so choose the skills you want to unlock carefully! If you&#39;re unsure which skills to unlock as shared skills, the skills of adventurers who join during the main campaign can be set as shared skills right away, so try equipping them in the meantime.</div><div><br></div><div>In addition to being available for purchase in the Shop, each month you&#39;ll be able to obtain a certain amount of elemental tomes, which are required in order to unlock shared skills, as rewards for events such as the onslaught events which start this month.</div><div><br></div><div>We also adjusted several action elements.</div><div>You&#39;ll now be able to dodge certain enemy attacks using the dodge action. You can avoid taking damage from enemy attacks with red action markers using the invulnerability time from skills or shapeshifting, but this can now also be done using the dodge action.</div><div><br></div><div>We&#39;ve also adjusted the normal attacks and combos for some weapon types.</div><div>There were a lot of openings in the normal attacks and combos for certain weapon types, but we alleviated that issue a little with these adjustments.</div><div><br></div><div>Both of these adjustments were made in order to make the action in the game more enjoyable.</div><div><br></div><div>We also reduced the damage for the attacks the bosses use immediately after the start of the quest in Advanced Dragon Trials. This may change the strategy for some adventurers, but we hope this adjustment will make it easier for more people to challenge these quests.</div><div><br></div><div>■This Month&#39;s Schedule<br>The first of a new event type, onslaught events, will start after the Timeworn Torment raid event ends.<br>These events will center around solo play and quests where you must defeat tons of enemies. In addition to enjoying a story that focuses on the adventurers, there are also quests where you must fight while shapeshifted.<br><br>In late June, the main campaign will be updated with the addition of chapter 14.<br>The prince and friends advance on the capital, Sol Alberia, and aim to take it back. In chapter 14, you&#39;ll be able to enter Sol Alberia, which is a new map.<br><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/701eaf2eaf2e2f5ce212618d432bdfc5.png"></div><div>What&#39;s more, a certain adventurer will join your roster when you clear chapter 14. There&#39;ll be big story developments in this chapter, so please play through chapter 13 to get ready for it!<br><br>■The Agito Uprising<br>Volk&#39;s Wrath: Master was released on May 25.<br>With the drop rewards from Master difficulty, you can enhance 6★ weapons to a new tier. Additionally, the material that drops in Master difficulty has been added to the weekly bonus for Volk&#39;s Wrath: Expert.<br><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/ce3b0f2536d0f722373c9e024260473e.png"></div><div><br></div><div>A new boss, Ayaha &amp; Otoha, will be added to The Agito Uprising at the end of this month.<br>Since this boss is actually two characters, they have some unique movements. I hope you&#39;re looking forward to it!<br><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/935c659f77c4ac3ee388b832e50a0c9a.png"></div><div><br></div><div>■Future Updates<br>The next update is scheduled for the end of June.<br>This update will include an increase to the number of team slots and reductions to the space requirements for the application.
