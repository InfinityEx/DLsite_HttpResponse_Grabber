image_path:

message:<div>The Dragalia Lost team would like to share some of the best tips and tricks for newcomers that we&#39;ve found so far. We hope that these pearls of wisdom will help newer players get off on the right foot and enjoy the game as much as possible. There may even be some tips that veteran players find useful!</div><div><br></div><hr><div>■Many menus got you down? Tap and hold to save time!</div><div>If you find yourself on another screen and want to repeat the last quest that you played, instead of tapping on Quests and going through the menus, you can tap and hold on the Home button to go straight to the quest screen. (Keep in mind that once you tap the Quests button, this will no longer bring you to the most recent quest.)</div><div><br></div><div>Instead of tapping on Castle, then Castle Grounds, you can tap and hold Castle to go straight to your Castle Grounds. This is great when you&#39;re starting out because the short build times on facilities means that you&#39;ll be entering and leaving your Castle Grounds fairly frequently as you set up and improve the Halidom.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/fe5c5bb6fb97e6967f9d9fc44274aa88.png"></div><div><br></div><div>■Strapped for rupies? Gold Fafnir has you covered!</div><div>If you&#39;re looking to fatten your wallet, try equipping some Gold Fafnir dragons and repeating the highest Avenue to Fortune quest that your team can handle. Gold Fafnirs have an ability that increases rupie intake for clearing quests, and it can make a big difference in the long run!</div><div><br></div><div>You can trade void seeds acquired from Void Battles for Gold Fafnirs in the Treasure Trade for Void Battles by tapping on the book icon on the top-right of the screen, then Shop, then Treasure Trade, then scroll down to Void Battles, then Special.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/d3cf85debde9e505552635a99239934f.png" style="width: 289px; height: 500px;"><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/5c98a6c6bd376dbebc40e87a06c2ed30.png" style="width: 289px; height: 500px;"></div><div><br></div><div>■Want to dive straight into the action? Skip ahead!</div><div>If you haven&#39;t cleared chapter 10 / 6-3 (Normal) of the main campaign yet, you can use the skip feature on the quest selection screen in chapters 1 through 10 to clear all of the main campaign quests on normal difficulty up to and including chapter 10.</div><div><br></div><div>Your player level will be increased and certain facilities in the Halidom will be constructed and improved automatically. What&#39;s more, you&#39;ll obtain the first clear rewards and quest endeavor rewards for all quests cleared using this feature, so there&#39;s no need to worry about missing any goodies!</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/bf481f7b75044a603952f6ed4958bab6.png" style="width: 289px; height: 500px;"></div><div><br></div><div>■Feeling a little lost in the story? There&#39;s a synopsis for that!</div><div>Players who use the skip feature can learn what happened in the stories they skipped by reading Notte&#39;s Super Rad Plot Synopsis, which is accessible from the Menu button on the top right of the Home screen in-game and at the website below.</div><div><a href="https://comic.dragalialost.com/plotsynopsis/en/">https://comic.dragalialost.com/plotsynopsis/en/</a></div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/142e542c143b88856ed16b3f92c7ee5e.png" style="width: 289px; height: 500px;"></div><div><br></div><div>■Tired of dodging? Sometimes offense is the best defense!</div><div>Have you noticed the red action markers that enemies use to show you where they&#39;re going to attack? You can always flick the screen to dodge out of this danger zone before they strike, but there&#39;s an entirely different way to avoid attacks.</div><div><br></div><div>Adventurer skill animations have a period in which the adventurer is protected against certain attacks. You can use a skill right when a red-action-marker attack activates to avoid taking damage while the skill is active. Note that this doesn&#39;t work with purple-action-marker attacks, so you&#39;ll still have to dodge those!</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/2d089e4be3ff7721946cb40b183c26ff.png" style="width: 289px; height: 500px;"><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/a3c382cd5bce1f2e34c518e0a7cd9051.png" style="width: 289px; height: 500px;"></div><div><br></div><div>■Want a quick might boost? Elements are elementary!</div><div>When building a team, you can match an adventurer&#39;s elemental attunement (flame, wind, shadow, etc.) to that of their equipped weapon and dragon for an attunement matching bonus that boosts their might.</div><div><br></div><div>With that said, it&#39;s tough to build a variety of same-element teams when you&#39;re just starting out, so we recommend that newer players put together a dream team of their strongest four adventurers, dragons, and weapons first, regardless of element.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/317861a6ec7adf708c453a6a61901ab5.png" style="width: 289px; height: 500px;"><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/a6b305994be9f037d8a166c359334350.png" style="width: 289px; height: 500px;"></div><div><br></div><div>■Flush with fafnir medals? Trade them for some powerhouse dragons!</div><div>You can get all kinds of rare materials and even Mini dragons by trading fafnir medals at the Treasure Trade for Fafnir Medals. Mini dragons have abilities that work with any element, so they&#39;re a great choice for newcomers to slot straight into their lineup.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/4b7c808947341a814fde08b00cfbae40.png" style="width: 289px; height: 500px;"><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/e14cb44b5dbeb1a6111db7161ccf36e5.png" style="width: 289px; height: 500px;"></div><div><br></div><div>■Not sure where to find needed materials? Check the details!</div><div>With so many materials required to craft and upgrade weapons and build and improve facilities, it can be difficult to keep track of where each material can be obtained. Don&#39;t fret though&mdash;if you want to know where a particular material comes from, simply tap on its icon, then tap on the How to Acquire button to see a list of quests that include the material as a possible reward. If the material can be obtained from the Treasure Trade, then you can use other materials to trade for it straight away by tapping on the Treasure Trade button instead.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/50f540a8cb50df01f87f4ee1073cfdeb.png" style="width: 289px; height: 500px;"><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/d19eab1f3624ed8cf9ca59dd124f707a.png" style="width: 289px; height: 500px;"></div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/2b1c2ec9d4703bea68a56a8b5c2fd84c.png" style="width: 289px; height: 500px;"><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/844b47c2dc2c9df7dfd721c8727d5ac7.png" style="width: 289px; height: 500px;"></div><div><br></div><div>■Ready for a routine? Clear out the daily endeavors!</div><div>You can easily earn a variety of useful items by completing daily endeavors. If you manage to complete them all, you&#39;ll even earn 50 wyrmite! Be sure to complete these endeavors every day for some great rewards.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/9974f580c387610afd34d07eb7a76ec2.png" style="width: 289px; height: 500px;"></div><div><br></div><div>■Not sure what to try next? Let Professor Notte lead the way!</div><div>The Royal Regimen is a great way to learn about the game at your own pace. Take on each of Professor Notte&#39;s structured drills to become familiar with different aspects of the game and earn some amazing rewards along the way.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/423d12b0f7560fb766cd2c4fab826a81.png" style="width: 289px; height: 500px;"><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/0c263175bde68ae4b3b09ce320d73e5f.png" style="width: 289px; height: 500px;"></div><div><br></div><div>■Worried about wasting stamina? Don&#39;t be!</div><div>Stamina (or getherwings in co-op) will not be spent if you fail a quest, so don&#39;t be afraid of wasting it. Improve your team and equipment and jump right back into the fray!</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/7ee690eab5655bd150b4e5930d50f7f4.png" style="width: 289px; height: 500px;"><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/4a21631815580e14b22626c91149908a.png" style="width: 289px; height: 500px;"></div><div><br></div><div>■Which wyrmprints are worth it? Aim for skill damage first!</div><div>Wyrmprints can be obtained from quests or the Treasure Trade for Wyrmprints in the Shop. If you&#39;re not sure which to invest in first, wyrmprints that increase skill damage are useful in a wide variety of situations. If you&#39;re looking for some deeper customization, find wyrmprints that will allow you to activate affinity bonuses!</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/e1845ba39356743c030de67245e8bff2.png" style="width: 289px; height: 500px;"><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/8201a17e2c8f8bd5a9a9cd47e0d6185e.png" style="width: 289px; height: 500px;"></div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/cbbd93294d0fc2d7feae727d59b31f6e.png" style="width: 289px; height: 500px;"><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/5eb09e1746c8ddc3dc336f1f292ead2c.png" style="width: 289px; height: 500px;"></div><div><br></div><div>■Free items in the Shop? Don&#39;t mind if I do!</div><div>In the Upgrade Essentials &amp; Packs section of the Shop, you can perform an item summon once per day for free. Possible rewards include rupies and materials for crafting weapons and improving your roster. Be sure to take advantage of this daily offer&mdash;you can&#39;t beat the price!</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/7dde03448816453d9f7fa3d4ed713228.png" style="width: 289px; height: 500px;"><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/4bfbee622b9e575870c1aba298b8c106.png" style="width: 289px; height: 500px;"><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/b17850584df6f3fd37f0c7fc781428be.png" style="width: 289px; height: 500px;"></div><div><br></div><div>■Up for some bartering?
