message:<div>Hello! Yuji Okada here, director of Dragalia Lost.</div><div><br></div><div>As always, thank you for playing Dragalia Lost.</div><div><br></div><div>I&#39;d like to begin my first monthly message of 2021 by wishing you all the best in the new year. As I reflect on the past and look forward to what&#39;s ahead, I am reminded that 2020 was a year of tectonic shifts and great struggle for many of us around the world. The Dragalia Lost team has dealt with many struggles of our own, but we have and will continue to work on developing the game while ensuring that we maintain the health and safety of everyone involved. Likewise, I speak for all of us when I say that it is our sincere wish that our players stay happy and healthy into the new year and beyond.</div><div><br></div><div>With that said, I&#39;d like to bring the focus back to Cursed Connections, the New Year&#39;s raid event that is currently live. You can recruit the adventurer Kuzunoha to your roster if you complete enough event quests to forge a lasting friendship with her. As you may notice playing through the event, this year&#39;s story shines a light on the more serious side of Hinomotoan affairs&mdash;much more so than last year&#39;s event and the one before that. Something tells me this isn&#39;t the last we&#39;ll see of the mysterious Mukuroshu...</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/9709c57bafa1d6b5699cfdf16a569c98.png"></div><div><br></div><div>Speaking of Hinomoto, Seimei and Gozu Tenno, members of the twelve wyrmclans, appear in the Cursed Connections (Part One) summon showcase that is currently live. At first glance Seimei may appear to care little for his allies, but as you play through the raid event story you will find just the opposite to be true. I hope you enjoy learning more about the relationship between Seimei and Gozu Tenno in particular.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/a5ee1ad7dd9dd0baa9beee463790b223.png"></div><div><br></div><div>A daily free tenfold summon event is currently live as well. The arrival of the new year is a cause for celebration, and we&#39;re ringing it in with a variety of beneficial events like log-in bonuses and the lucky letters raffle. Be sure to take full advantage of these events by logging in every day.</div><div><br></div><div>There will also be a second daily free tenfold summon event that will allow you to perform a tenfold summon on the Cursed Connections (Part Two) showcase for free once per day for three days. This showcase will feature another member of the twelve wyrmclans, Yoshitsune. Further information on this adventurer, including her element and weapon, is available in the in-game notifications, on the official website, and on our social media channels.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/17998adaa892860e35c14b2211b29e0f.png"></div><div><br></div><div>■Plans for This Month</div><div>・The Cursed Connections raid event will be followed up by a coliseum event. This event will be similar in style to onslaught events and defensive battles, but it will give players the chance to test their might against Hinomoto&#39;s best fighters in gladiatorial combat. It&#39;s not all about conflict, though, as players will also be able to learn more about the stories behind the various Hinomotoan competitors.</div><div><br></div><div>・A high-difficulty quest involving Morsayati will be added in mid-January. Players who overcome this challenge will be able to earn materials for upgrading facilities that boost adventurers of certain elements or weapon types and items that augment dragons. Please note that this quest may not be attempted until you have viewed the epilogue for the Forgotten Truths event in the Event Compendium. In addition, it has been designed to challenge teams of a very high might, but is not quite as difficult as the Legend difficulty of The Agito Uprising, nor does it require that only adventurers of a specific element be used.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/7a5f63a03ed928f01357fd5345f02f88.png"></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>・An interlude will be added to chapter 17 of the main campaign.</div><div><br></div><div>・The Scars of the Syndicate raid event will make a return in late January. You&#39;ll have a chance to add the adventurer Aldred to your team if you haven&#39;t already.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/b4eb7beb4afbf4ff3ac78f894ea0a4fb.png"></div><div><br></div><div>・The Accursed Archives facility event will be added to the Event Compendium in late January.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/296ddc0c69e83a979ed6d7ba30fe6107.png"></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>・The Legend difficulty for Kai Yan&#39;s Wrath in The Agito Uprising will be added. As with Volk&#39;s Wrath: Legend, this quest will prove quite challenging, so please look forward to pushing your top team to its limits.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/35637db8426b2f6e994196f0dd657ab2.png"></div><div><br></div><div>■Future Updates<br>・As mentioned in last month&#39;s installment of This Month in Dragalia Lost, we will be announcing further details about an upcoming event live in early January, so please stay tuned!<br><br>・We will continue to regularly update the main campaign with new story chapters, but starting with chapter 18 these chapters will be split into two parts, each releasing monthly. Part one of chapter 18 will be released in February and part two will be released in March. Chapters 19 and beyond will follow this schedule accordingly. As the Prince navigates the unexplored lands to the north, he comes closer and closer to that which he has sought for so long...<br><br>・New bosses to follow the Agito Uprising will be released starting around March. These bosses aren&#39;t just fresh new faces, they also bring fresh new gameplay mechanics to the table, so be sure to keep your skills sharp!<br><br>・Though it&#39;s a bit early to be discussing the next Dragalia Digest in detail, we do plan to continue using it to communicate major announcements every six months. The upcoming episode in late March will cover a special event. Here&#39;s a hint to tide you over: players will be able to enjoy this event even more if they have played the main campaign and the Fractured Futures and Forgotten Truths raid events in the Event Compendium.<br><br>■In Conclusion<br>I hope that the first installment of This Month in Dragalia Lost for the year 2021 has helped you start it off right, and I, along with the rest of the team who works so hard to bring the Dragalia Lost game to life, look forward to continuing our journey with you well into this year and beyond.<br><br>In closing, we&#39;re giving all players the following items this month.<br><br>・Sunlight Ore x3<br>・Damascus Crystal x3<br>・Exquisite Honey x30<br>・10,000,000 rupies<br><br>The next installment of This Month in Dragalia Lost will be posted around <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1612159200"></span>.<br><br>Until then, thanks for reading, and for continuing to play Dragalia Lost!<br><br>Yuji Okada<br>Director, Dragalia Lost<br><br>Notes:<br>・The gift can be claimed from your goodie box for up to seven days after reception.
