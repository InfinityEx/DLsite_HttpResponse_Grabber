It was held to celebrate the 3.5-year anniversary, but there are some connections to the events of chapter 25 of the main campaign as well. You can recruit the adventurer Origa to your roster if you complete enough event quests to forge a lasting friendship with her. Along the way, you will lock horns with Bahamut&#39;s unique form in a raid battle. This fight was designed to pack plenty of punch, so give it your all and don&#39;t back down!</div><div><br></div><div>・The adventurers Bondforged Prince and Bondforged Zethia (who make their debuts in the aforementioned raid event) are featured in the Gala Dragalia summon showcase available now.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/bb889983d047b74d71d3da67598d9e4f.png"></div><div><br></div><div>Let&#39;s also give a warm welcome to Gala Nedrick, who made his debut as an adventurer in the Gala Dragalia available from <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1648360800"></span> to <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1648706399"></span>!</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/8ef7f32fe0bca806161e388bcac45754.png"></div><div><br></div><div>■Plans for This Month</div><div>・The Sands of Revelation defensive event returns on <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1650002400"></span>.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/83d810dd09bdf7461de436c60e8d9370.png"></div><div><br></div><div>・The Resplendent Refrain raid event returns on <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1650607200"></span>.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/86a7a59da45d7760dfe77febff813977.png"></div><div><br></div><div>・The Echoes of Antiquity raid event returns on <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1651212000"></span>.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/9129590fea5f2a114ceb83827483f0a5.png"></div><div><br></div><div>・Primal Zodiark&#39;s Trial will be added to Primal Dragon Trials on <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1650866400"></span>.
