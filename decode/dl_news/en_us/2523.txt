message:<div>On September 26, 2021, Dragalia Lost director Yuji Okada replied to feedback players sent via the in-game Leave Feedback feature.</div><div><br></div><div>This notification contains the contents of an interview with director Okada that was conducted by Yumi Uchiyama and Ayaka Asai, voice actors for the Japanese-language version of Dragalia Lost.</div><div><br></div><div>Notes:</div><div>・The feedback featured in this notification was chosen from that received between August 1 and August 31.</div><div>・Tap Feedback on the game&#39;s title screen to open the Leave Feedback screen.</div><div>・The content of the interview has been edited for this notification, so wording may differ from the original conversation.</div><div>・The content of the responses is from the time of the interview, so content that is in development may differ by the time of its release in-game.</div><div><br></div><hr><div>■Responses to Feedback from Players</div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: In response to the news that the Suggested Teams feature will be updated in the near future to recommend the most successful teams for co-op quests, a player wrote in to request support for shared skills (even if they are not set automatically). At the moment, shared skills are not displayed, so players who want to investigate the most popular loadouts in co-op are left guessing as to which shared skills are best to use.</div><div><br></div><div>Okada: The Suggested Teams feature was updated so that players can see what teams have been most successful in certain co-op quests in the version 2.12.0 update that was released around <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1632452400"></span>. We will continually work toward improving this feature, and you will be able to set and view shared skills in a future update.</div><div><br></div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: We&#39;ve received a request to add the skip feature to the Standard and Expert difficulties of the Agito Uprising.</div><div><br></div><div>Okada: We will consider expanding the skip feature in a future update. As the game has grown older, players have had the chance to try their hand at a wide variety of high-difficulty content, including Advanced Dragon Trials, the Agito Uprising, and Rise of the Sinister Dominion. With the upcoming addition of even more high-difficulty quests, it behooves us to ensure that players are not overwhelmed by the amount of content available, so we are considering allowing certain quests to be skipped after they have been cleared for the first time.</div><div><br></div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: Although the amp mechanic is still relatively new, the number of adventurers who make use of it is only going to increase over time, so players have requested the addition of an amp filter to the sorting screen.</div><div><br></div><div>Okada: Amps can have a significant impact on the performance of your team, so we will consider adding the ability to sort by amps in the future.</div><div><br></div><div>■Questions About the September 23rd Dragalia Digest</div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: We&#39;d like to ask a few questions about the latest episode of Dragalia Digest. To start off, could you elaborate on the upcoming Enter the Kaleidoscape event? It appears to be a dungeon crawler, but the mechanics are a little overwhelming at first glance, so we&#39;re worried that newer players may struggle to complete it.</div><div><br></div><div>Okada: In this event, you begin your exploration of the Kaleidoscape with a single adventurer who starts off at level 1. The goal is to reach the bottom of the labyrinth&mdash;or at least, as far down as you can&mdash;without being defeated. As you proceed further and further down, your adventurer will level up and find all sorts of weapons, wyrmprints, skills, and dragons to help them survive along the way. You&#39;ll have a new experience each time you play, so you&#39;ll have to remain flexible and base your minute-to-minute strategy on what lies in your way at any given moment.</div><div><br></div><div>While you can&#39;t bring the weapons, wyrmprints, skills, or dragons that you find strewn about the labyrinth back home with you, you can exchange the points you earn for various items or even spend them to give you added advantages during your subsequent runs.</div><div><br></div><div>If you manage to complete the journey, you will earn a wyrmprint that features a portrait of the adventurer you used. Each and every adventurer has their own unique wyrmprint and each wyrmprint differs slightly in abilities, but they can be equipped by any adventurer. You will still earn one of these wyrmprints if you quit partway through, but reaching the end will reward you with one which has a wider variety of abilities.</div><div><br></div><div>This may all sound a bit overwhelming at first, but everyone starts off on the same page, so newer players will not have to worry about preparing anything in advance&mdash;though I will say that a veteran player&#39;s knowledge may certainly come in handy. With that said, my humble advice is to simply dive in headfirst and enjoy the experience!</div><div><br></div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: Will players be able to take their time with this event, or will it only be available for a limited time? If it is a permanent addition, will there be occasional updates to look forward to?</div><div><br></div><div>Okada: Once released, Enter the Kaleidoscape will be available to play at any time. We do plan to update this event with more content sometime in the future, but since there is merit to completing it with each and every one of your adventurers, we think that players will have fun exploring the ever-shifting labyrinth for quite a while.</div><div><br></div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: Can you share anything more about the upcoming series of high-difficulty quests? Will they be on the same level as what we have now, or even more difficult? Also, will they have restrictions on the elemental attunements and weapons that can be used?</div><div><br></div><div>Okada: For those who have yet to watch the latest Dragalia Digest, these quests will have you face off against the Five Greatwyrms in their primordial forms. Exactly why you&#39;re going up against these particular foes will be revealed in future story developments, but for now I can say that we plan to offer a variety of difficulties, with the most difficult naturally being extremely challenging. At the moment, we do not plan to impose any restrictions on the types of teams that players can put together.</div><div><br></div><hr><div>Director Okada will continue to reply to the feedback players send via Leave Feedback again in the future. We&#39;re looking forward to hearing your comments. (The feedback featured in the next notification will be chosen from feedback received between September 1 and September 30.)</div><div><br></div><div>Thank you for playing Dragalia Lost.</div>
