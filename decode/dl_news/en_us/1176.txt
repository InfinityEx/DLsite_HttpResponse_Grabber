They also confer a special effect that lets you deal more damage to enemies in quests for the facility event where the facility was obtained.

The materials required to level up event facilities differ based on the event.</div><div><br></div><div>■Event Bonuses</div><div>For each facility event in the Event Compendium, there are wyrmprints that have bonus effects during that event. These wyrmprints can be obtained as endeavor rewards, or from the Treasure Trade for wyrmprints. Switching between events will also switch which wyrmprints appear on the Featured tab in the Treasure Trade for wyrmprints.<br>・The amount of event bonus effect differs based on the wyrmprint and how much the wyrmprint has been unbound.</div><div><br></div><div><br>■Available Events <span style="color: rgb(41, 105, 176);">[Updated at <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1621231200"></span>]</span><br>The following twelve events are available starting at <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1621231200"></span>.<br><br>If chapter 2 / 2-1 of the main campaign is cleared on Normal difficulty:<br>・Flames of Reflection (facility event)<br>・The Miracle of Dragonyule (facility event)<br>・A Wish to the Winds (facility event)<br>・Dream Big Under the Big Top (facility event)<br>・The Hunt for Harmony (facility event)<br>・Trick or Treasure!
