message:<div>Dragalia Lost director Yuji Okada replied to feedback players sent via the in-game Leave Feedback feature.</div><div><br></div><div>This notification contains the contents of an interview with director Okada that was conducted by Yumi Uchiyama and Ayaka Asai, voice actors for the Japanese-language version of Dragalia Lost.</div><div><br></div><div>Notes:</div><div>・Tap Feedback on the game&#39;s title screen to open the Leave Feedback screen.</div><div>・The content of the interview has been edited for this notification, so wording may differ from the original conversation.</div><div>・The content of the responses is from the time of the interview, so content that is in-development may differ by the time of release in-game.</div><div><br></div><hr><div>■Responses to Feedback</div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: First off, <strong>can any Dragalia Lost player use Leave Feedback to send feedback?</strong></div><div>Okada: Yes. Anyone can use the button in the bottom right corner of the title screen to send feedback. Today I hope to respond to certain bits of feedback we hear frequently.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: In that case, let&#39;s get right into it. <strong>There&#39;s a lot of feedback saying that crafting and dismantling weapons is a lot of work, but are there any plans to change that in the future?</strong></div><div>Okada: Yes. It&#39;s still in development, but we plan to drastically change the mechanisms for crafting, enhancing, and dismantling weapons.</div><div><br></div><div>Right now, there are a lot of different types of weapons and many players probably do not know which they should craft. I can&#39;t share in too much detail yet, but we want to make it easier to tell which weapons you should craft and increase customizability. It will be a big change, so please wait until then. We will make sure the weapons you have already crafted and materials you have already obtained do not go to waste.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: <strong>On that note, it&#39;s possible to both dismantle and sell weapons, but which do you recommend?</strong></div><div>Okada: I think it depends on the player, but if you have lots of rupies, then you&#39;ll get materials from dismantling weapons. If you don&#39;t have many rupies, then I&#39;d recommend selling them.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: I see! So it depends on the player, then. Thank you. On to the next question. <strong>Will you increase the number of team slots?</strong></div><div>Okada: We are hoping to make radical changes to this one, too. We are currently developing ways for players to be able to thoroughly customize their teams. We hope to both increase the number of team slots and make it possible to configure precise details. The recent addition of chain co-abilities was part of this as well, but we want players to enjoy putting together various teams. Unfortunately, the current number of team slots and the way teams are managed makes this difficult, so we are developing ways to change that.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: I would like it if I could tie wyrmprints and weapons to individual adventurers.</div><div>Okada: Interesting. [Laughs] I&#39;ll be sure to take that back to the team!</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: Thank you! <strong>The next question is about difficulty. Apparently some users would like to see the difficulty level lowered while others would like to see it raised. What do you think about that?</strong></div><div>Okada: Yeah, we truly have received a lot of different feedback about this. Some players find the current content lacking and want more satisfying content while others are struggling with the game as it is now and want content that they can easily tackle, so we are currently working to increase content for various levels of players.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: People started playing at different times, so I guess those who just started recently might find the game difficult.</div><div>Okada: And there are also those who have been playing since the release of the game or those who enthusiastically play the game but find it lacking. We are currently working to both add difficulty levels to existing quests and add more content to the game, though it is taking some time, so we want to achieve a state where there is both high-difficulty content and content that is easy to play.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: <strong>The next bit of feedback is about the game&#39;s space requirements. Are there plans to make the game require a little less space?</strong></div><div>Okada: We&#39;ve been receiving this feedback for a while and in truth we have made several adjustments up to this point, but as we keep adding events the game keeps getting bigger. Even so, we are currently working to make adjustments to reduce it, even if only a little.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: Like how the 2D mana circle screen was added.</div><div>Okada: It&#39;s fine the first time you look at the mana circles, but if you look at them many times, sometimes the screen transitions feel slow or processing slows down on older devices, so we prepared a 2D screen that users can maneuver quickly and efficiently.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: <strong>Next up, we&#39;ve received various feedback about the mentor bonus.</strong></div><div>Okada: In regard to the mentor bonus, we&#39;ve received feedback that matching is challenging and that it feels like you have a weekly quota, but it&#39;s time-consuming to try to fill that quota. In a version update, we made it possible to set the mentor bonus as a condition when creating rooms so we will make adjustments in the future depending on how that goes.</div><div><br></div><div>However, based on our data there are still many who have not cleared the Advanced Dragon Trials, so I think it is necessary for us to create a clear path to clearing quests like those and support users who are unsure what to do next.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: While we have you, would you answer some questions that we prepared? <strong>We&#39;d like the facility level maximum to be increased.</strong></div><div>Okada: This is a bit of a hot topic, and in the April update we did raise the maximum level for rupie mines and elemental altars to level 40. We will continue to monitor the situation and consider raising the level for facilities.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: <strong>We&#39;d also like to be able to trade for the high-rarity orbs.</strong></div><div>Okada: [Laughs] I&#39;ll take this back to the team for consideration. This is another thing we hope to monitor the situation for before addressing.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: Here&#39;s another question for you. <strong>Is there anything that players should keep in mind when putting their team of four adventurers in order?</strong></div><div>Okada: Order has not been particularly important up to this point, but in a future update the leader, or the adventurer in the first position, will be able to equip skills from other adventurers, so the adventurer you set as the first member of a team will be an important decision.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: <strong>We&#39;d also like to ask about the main campaign. Are there any highlights we should be looking forward to?</strong></div><div>Okada: Chapter 14 will be a critical point in the story. It&#39;s scheduled for release in June, so be sure to check it out. I also mentioned it in This Month in Dragalia Lost, but a new member will join the group in chapter 14.</div><div><br></div><hr><div>We plan on asking director Okada to reply to the feedback players send via Leave Feedback again in the future. We&#39;re looking forward to hearing your comments.</div><div><br></div><div>Thank you for playing Dragalia Lost.</div>
