message:<div>On June 6, 2021, Dragalia Lost director Yuji Okada replied to feedback players sent via the in-game Leave Feedback feature.</div><div><br></div><div>This notification contains the contents of an interview with director Okada that was conducted by Yumi Uchiyama and Ayaka Asai, voice actors for the Japanese-language version of Dragalia Lost.</div><div><br></div><div>Notes:</div><div>・The feedback featured in this notification was chosen from feedback received between April 1 and April 30.</div><div>・Tap Feedback on the game&#39;s title screen to open the Leave Feedback screen.</div><div>・The content of the interview has been edited for this notification, so wording may differ from the original conversation.</div><div>・The content of the responses is from the time of the interview, so content that is in development may differ by the time of release in-game.</div><div><br></div><hr><div>■Responses to Feedback</div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: First up, it sounds like players are saying that they want to be able to choose whether to receive the daily bonus for Trials of the Mighty, similar to how the weekly bonus works for things like The Agito Uprising. They&#39;re saying that it&#39;s inconvenient for them, because right now, they&#39;re unable to play the difficulty level they want, when they want.</div><div><br></div><div>Okada: Currently, the daily bonus for the Trials of the Mighty will automatically be sent to players&#39; goodie boxes when they clear it.</div><div><br></div><div>There can sometimes be two or three different bosses appearing at the same time in Trials of the Mighty. You stock up on daily bonuses, but since you&#39;ll automatically receive those rewards once you clear it, some players might feel like it&#39;s a little inconvenient. We&#39;re preparing to implement a pop-up in a future update, which will say something like, &quot;Accept rewards?&quot; This will allow players to choose whether they&#39;d like to receive the daily bonus. We sincerely appreciate everyone&#39;s patience.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: Here&#39;s another thing that players are asking for. They&#39;re saying that they&#39;d like even more team slots. There are different team compositions for solo and co-op, there are quests that require two teams, such as Rise of the Sinister Dominion, and there are quests that have restrictions on team formation, such as Trials of the Mighty. Even though there&#39;s a function to be able to recall teams in the History section of the team selection menu, they&#39;re saying that it&#39;s not a good enough measure, since they still have to organize the team for each quest. They&#39;re asking for some more help here.</div><div><br></div><div>Okada: We&#39;re considering what to do regarding team formation. As more content is being added to the game, such as Trials of the Mighty, which has restrictions on weapon types and attributes, and Rise of the Sinister Dominion, which requires players to prepare two teams of differing elemental attunements, I think that the number of teams players will need to deal with these situations is also increasing.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: Next up, we have some player feedback about Time Attack Challenges. While players are quite happy that the Time Attack Challenges distribute lots of champion&#39;s testaments and rupies, they&#39;re saying that if there&#39;s anything else they could ask for, it&#39;s that they feel like the clear time limit is unnecessary. Players feel that since they&#39;ve already finished upgrading, they can meet the clear time. But they&#39;re afraid that new players, who are the ones who really need the champion&#39;s testaments and rupies, won&#39;t be able to. They added that since you&#39;re apparently looking into other ways to help new players, they&#39;d like you to consider this as well.</div><div><br></div><div>Okada: Well, there are ranking rewards in the Time Attack Challenges, and many more of the players who have taken on these challenges have completed quests within the allotted time. I think that players who have just started out might have a tougher time, but there are trades, other events, and the Event Compendium. So, if those players gradually get items and such from those sources, then I think they&#39;ll slowly but surely get better at the Time Attack Challenges and be able to clear them in time.</div><div>I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be quite difficult to make it in the rankings, but we think that one of the most interesting aspects of the game is when you gradually get within the set time, little by little. We&#39;ll continue to keep a close eye on balance in the future though, so please give it your best try.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: This player first wanted to say thank you, Mr. Okada, and thank you to your team. This player is incredibly interested in adventurer stories for Prince Phares and Prince Valyx, as well as the individual Agito (including Nedrick), so they were wondering if you could release something for them.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Okada: Prince Phares, Prince Valyx, and the Agito certainly are in a rather complicated situation right now in the main campaign. We are thinking about it. We sincerely hope that you&#39;ll look forward to when we&#39;re able to talk more about it, once the main campaign progresses more. Please hang in there.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: One player says that they&#39;re feeling sad, since it seems like Leif hasn&#39;t been appearing in the main campaign lately. They want to see Leif in action!</div><div><br></div><div>Okada: We&#39;re planning on delving more deeply into other characters in the main campaign. So, just like how Sarisse had reappeared after a long absence in the current invasion event, The Children of Yggdrasil, we&#39;re planning to bring in other characters in other upcoming events. Leif may also appear in other events and castle stories.</div><div><br></div><hr><div>Director Okada will continue to reply to the feedback players send via Leave Feedback again in the future. We&#39;re looking forward to hearing your comments. (The feedback featured in the next notification will be chosen from feedback received between May 1 and May 31.)</div><div><br></div><div>Thank you for playing Dragalia Lost.</div>
