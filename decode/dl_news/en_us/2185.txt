It also boosts the damage that adventurers deal against enemies in event quests.

Extra boss battles occasionally appear after clearing the event boss battle on Expert difficulty.<br><br>Even if you clear the boss battle several times in a row using the auto-repeat feature, the extra boss battle will only become available once at most. It will disappear again after being successfully cleared. Once the conditions for the quest are met, you can unlock it repeatedly.

If you fail to reach the last wave in Expert or Master difficulty, you will still receive rewards for the ones you did clear, but in Nightmare difficulty you must complete the final wave to earn rewards.<br><br>Finally, the drop rate for rewards differs based on the difficulty. The drop rate for rewards in Nightmare difficulty is the same as Master difficulty. Once per day when you clear Nightmare difficulty, you can get a Grand Bounty.
