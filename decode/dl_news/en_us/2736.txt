message:<div>Hello, everyone! Yuji Okada here, director of Dragalia Lost.</div><div><br></div><div>First off, as always, thank you for playing Dragalia Lost. I&#39;m again excited to bring you the latest news on what&#39;s happening in and around the game during the first month of 2022. On behalf of the entire team, I wish everyone a very happy new year and hope that you continue to enjoy your adventures in Dragalia Lost this year as well.</div><div><br></div><div>To help you start 2022 off right, we&#39;re ringing in the new year with a whole host of events including the traditional daily free tenfold summon. Be sure to check the Notices section for more information on what&#39;s happening and when&mdash;there&#39;s a lot to keep track of, and you don&#39;t want to miss any of it!</div><div><br></div><div>■Last Month in Review</div><div>The game received two major content updates last month.</div><div><br></div><div>▼Enter The Kaleidoscape!</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/bb7c285336146871d1debbcf8d06fefe.png"></div><div><br></div><div>How are you enjoying the Kaleidoscape? Exploring, fighting, and surviving all the way to floor 50 with a single adventurer may seem like a tall order, but I&#39;m sure that as you get more and more used to how this new mode and its mechanics work, you&#39;ll be able to successfully navigate the perils of the labyrinth with all of your favorite adventurers. For those of you who manage to master its intricacies in the coming days, fear not&mdash;we plan to perform gameplay adjustments and add even more floors as time goes on. We&#39;d love to hear what you think of the Kaleidoscape thus far, so please give it a go and consider sending us your impressions and suggestions via the Leave Feedback feature in-game.</div><div><br></div><div>▼Challenge Primal Midgardsormr!</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/36ff0fa8d28249fca00c1e54f792c819.png"></div><div><br></div><div>There&#39;s a new series of high-difficulty quests in town! In Primal Midgardsormr&#39;s Trial, you&#39;ll have to stay on your toes as Humanoid Midgardsormr shapeshifts into Primal Midgardsormr partway through the fight. The struggle to subdue the primordial greatwyrms will be worth it, though, as you can use materials dropped from each of these bosses to craft powerful 6★ Primal Dragon weapons that match their elemental attunement. We plan to add quests for the remaining four greatwyrms in the future, so prepare your roster for the trials ahead!</div><div><br></div><div>■The Celestial Showdown Raid Event Is Here!</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/7ac8ea7288ebe8d74981c77f8e21f3ba.png"></div><div><br></div><div>A new raid event, Celestial Showdown, is available now. You can recruit the adventurer Izumo to your roster if you complete enough event quests to forge a lasting friendship with him. Don&#39;t forget to collect the event adventurer upgrade items either!</div><div><br></div><div>As is tradition for New Year&#39;s events, the story revolves around the affairs of the distant land of Hinomoto, and you&#39;ll have to face the fearsome Tsukuyomi in a heated battle. It&#39;s finally time for the twelve wyrmclan leaders to band together and show us what they&#39;re made of.</div><div><br></div><div>Speaking of wyrmclan leaders, the adventurers Shingen and Yukimura and the dragon Fudo Myo-o (all of whom appear in this event) are featured in a Gala Dragalia available now.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/c0a5923159099ac41e1c6d18f71fa31e.png"></div><div><br></div><div>■Plans for This Month</div><div>・Water- and shadow-attuned versions of Iblis will appear as raid bosses in Trials of the Mighty this month.
