message:<div>In the co-op version of the Iblis&#39;s Surging Cascade (Ranked) quest that was available during the Time Attack Challenges event that took place between <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1634709600"></span> and <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1635400799"></span>, an issue occurred that made it possible to unintentionally avoid the effects of Curse of Nihility inflicted by Fallen Angel Uriel&#39;s Piercing Emptiness skill (used at the outset of the quest) under certain network conditions.</div><div><br></div><div>Since Curse of Nihility (or lack thereof) can greatly affect an adventurer&#39;s performance, we believe that this issue may have had an outsize effect on the standings for the co-op version of the Iblis&#39;s Surging Cascade (Ranked) quest.</div><div><br></div><div>We have also confirmed that a similar issue may occur in other quests. When resolving this issue, we will alter how the boss behaves in affected quests such as those currently available in Rise of the Sinister Dominion and Trials of the Mighty. For further details, please see the corresponding in-game notifications once they are updated.</div><div><br></div><div>The effects of this issue on the most recent Time Attack Challenges event will be addressed as explained below.</div><div><br></div><div>1. Regarding the Reward Epithets</div><div>Players who earned an epithet that was rewarded for achieving a certain clear time will no longer have access to that epithet. As a gesture of goodwill, we will award every player who was eligible for such a reward in this event with a substitute epithet in the coming days. (This epithet will be the same for all players.) We will notify players once we have determined when this change will take place.</div><div><br></div><div>Class rewards and rewards earned from clearing quests will not be affected.</div><div><br></div><div>2. Regarding the Return of This Event</div><div>We would like to make this event available again once this issue has been addressed, but we currently do not have a time frame for when that will be possible. We will notify players once the date and time have been determined.</div><div><br></div><div>Please note that rankings for the 10th Time Attack Challenges event are no longer available on the official website.</div><div><br></div><div>Thank you for your understanding and for playing Dragalia Lost.</div>
