message:<div>Hello, everyone! Yuji Okada here, director of Dragalia Lost.</div><div><br></div><div>First off, as always, thank you for playing Dragalia Lost.</div><div><br></div><div>■Caged Desire is Here!</div><div>Caged Desire, a crossover event with the Persona series of games, is now live. The Phantom Thieves of Hearts have arrived in the world of Dragalia Lost, and one of them, Sophie, will join you for the duration of the event.</div><div><br></div><div>If you&#39;d like to recruit Sophie into your roster permanently, don&#39;t forget to add her to your team as you complete event quests to build friendship with her. Along the way, be sure to collect upgrade items called Sophie&#39;s Convictions from emblem rewards, blazon summons, and endeavors. Play enough and you&#39;ll be able to earn the amount needed to completely unlock her mana circles!</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/57318de17823d2ad019e5e71d0642b18.png"></div><div><br></div><div>Sophie has special abilities that activate in quests for this event. She&#39;ll prove invaluable by helping exploit the enemy&#39;s weaknesses in this event&#39;s raid battles and trial quests. Develop her as much as you can and you&#39;re sure to see a return on your investment.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/520109310371766716eb5485f81c973f.png"></div><div><br></div><div>If you&#39;re looking for even more action with the Phantom Thieves, the adventurers Joker and Mona and the dragon Ars&egrave;ne are featured in a summon showcase going on now.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/5d55e43cca2acf00c50760e115494f6a.png"></div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/2100e7f126389590f683ead17440c022.png"></div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/948f4cc9c3de60d6d5f717d8d8515080.png"></div><div>Joker and Mona can each expend their Persona gauge to call upon their very own Persona (Ars&egrave;ne and Zorro, respectively) to fight at their side. Ars&egrave;ne also makes an appearance as a dragon who can be equipped by other adventurers. Adventurers other than Joker can shapeshift into Ars&egrave;ne by filling their dragon gauge as normal.</div><div><br></div><div>We hope that fans of the Persona series will enjoy the marriage of the Phantom Thieves&#39; trademark visual style with Dragalia Lost&#39;s unique action combat.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/3970de0d783f2bfe2115bd1b7f108dfe.png"></div><div><br></div><div>Speaking of style, the adventurer Panther will appear in an upcoming summon showcase. Although she&#39;s technically a lance user in terms of Dragalia Lost weaponry, fans will no doubt recognize the whip that she uses to great effect when attacking and the hail of machine gun bullets when she performs a force strike. Just like fellow Phantom Thieves Joker and Mona, she can expend her Persona gauge to call upon her very own Persona, Carmen, to fight at her side. For further details including her stats, check out the summon showcase notification once it&#39;s posted.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/2a9ec69bca26185b1abf0954db199fcf.png"></div><div><br></div><div>The Caged Desire event includes many ways for players to earn items that power up their team. You can earn insignias used to craft weapons and upgrade facilities, and from boss battles and raid events, you can get orbs and scales used to unbind adventurers&#39; mana circles. What&#39;s more, champion&#39;s testaments used to unbind mana circles, and damascus ingots used to unbind 5★ weapons, are available from the Treasure Trade.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/5f04188449c811b2095a874f89a5dbc1.png"></div><div><br></div><div>And what would an event be without some exclusive rewards? Players can earn some event-exclusive wyrmprints, weapon skins, and stickers.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/bb0a88fffc77a1d8f18b869fd17c1ad3.png"></div><div><br></div><div>The fun even extends to the Alberian Battle Royale as well. There, every adventurer will be able to shapeshift into Ars&egrave;ne, and a mode-specific skill will become available if Joker is set as your adventurer skin.</div><div><br></div><div>The Caged Desire event ends on <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1613109540"></span>. I wish you the best of luck in bringing Emile back from the brink with a flair and style that only the Phantom Thieves can pull off!</div><div><br></div><div>■Plans for This Month<br>・A Valentine&#39;s-themed onslaught event will be held in mid-February. Who better to celebrate this day of romance than Luca&#39;s long-time admirer, Chelsea? I hope you&#39;re looking forward to a new version of this lass longing for love and another episode in her seemingly never-ending saga to capture Luca&#39;s heart.<br><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/f0b81e7a015822ec52f8c2f903a3ebc7.png"></div><div><br></div><div>・The A Waltz with Fate raid event will make a return in mid-February. You&#39;ll have the chance to add the adventurer Felicia to your team if you haven&#39;t already.<br><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/19ee3ee64c9742871a25dca430f89808.png"><br>・Starting with part one of chapter 18, one half of each main campaign chapter will be added each month. The first half (part one) of chapter 18 will be added in late February. Our heroes have their sights set on the Faerie Kingdom, but will they be able to navigate the forest of the faeries?<br><br>・A Time Attack Rankings event will be held in late February. This time, you&#39;ll face light-attuned foes.<br><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/788872a87275bf0a8b3a2975cc5453ec.png"></div><div>・A new facility event will be held in late February. Following the events of the story that was released last September, the plot will center around apostles of North Grastaea&#39;s Ilian Church. Here&#39;s a sneak peek at one of the apostles who will also appear as an adventurer: A young man named Faris.<br><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/e655034e8c5a11ad8ef03122296f5cb6.png"></div><div><br></div><div>■Future Updates<br>・Rise of the Sinister Dominion, the first in a new series of quests to follow the Agito Uprising, pits you against powerful bosses, and arrives in early March. With the addition of this quest, the number of wyrmprint slots available to weapons will be increased and players will be able to earn wyrmprints that can only be equipped to those specific slots. Further details on this system will be provided next month.<br><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/c65da2969ecd9bb40a50b510956ddd09.png"><br>・In the next version update, players will be able to copy their team setups to and from different slots in the Teams menu. You can also register an individual adventurer&#39;s weapon, dragon, and wyrmprints to the adventurer themselves instead of to a particular team setup. With new varieties of quests being added over time, we hope that this feature will help players more quickly and easily manage the best teams from their roster.<br><br>In addition, a button that allows players to permit adventurers to shapeshift into their equipped dragon automatically during auto-play will be added. This setting also works with the auto-repeat feature, so you may find that the extra boost from shapeshifting has opened up some quests that you weren&#39;t able to auto-repeat before.<br><br>■In Conclusion<br>We on the Dragalia Lost team hope that you enjoy all of the new and upcoming content that I&#39;ve shared, starting of course with the Caged Desire event going on now.<br><br>And finally, we&#39;re giving all players the following items this month.<br><br>・Eldwater &times; 200,000<br>・Consecrated Water &times; 300<br><br>I hope that you&#39;ll use these items to expand and upgrade your collection of wyrmprints. Adventurers and dragons may stand out when building a team, but don&#39;t forget that the effective selection of wyrmprints can also greatly contribute to your success!<br><br>You can trade eldwater for the wyrmprints of your choice in the Treasure Trade for wyrmprints, so check out the Shop and see if any strike your fancy. Once you&#39;ve found some you like, be sure to upgrade them with consecrated water. You can also spend eldwater to unlock certain nodes on mana circles and make your favorite adventurers even stronger.<br><br>The next installment of This Month in Dragalia Lost will be posted around <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1614578400"></span>.<br><br>Until then, thanks for reading, and for continuing to play Dragalia Lost!<br><br>Yuji Okada<br>Director, Dragalia Lost<br><br>Notes:<br>・The gift can be claimed from your goodie box for up to seven days after reception.
