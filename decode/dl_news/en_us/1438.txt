message:<div>On June 28, 2020, Dragalia Lost director Yuji Okada replied to feedback players sent via the in-game Leave Feedback feature.</div><div><br></div><div>This notification contains the contents of an interview with director Okada that was conducted by Yumi Uchiyama and Ayaka Asai, voice actors for the Japanese-language version of Dragalia Lost.</div><div><br></div><div>Notes:</div><div>・Tap Feedback on the game&#39;s title screen to open the Leave Feedback screen.</div><div>・The content of the interview has been edited for this notification, so wording may differ from the original conversation.</div><div>・The content of the responses is from the time of the interview, so content that is in-development may differ by the time of release in-game.</div><div><br></div><hr><div>■Responses to Feedback</div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: First up we have feedback about Wu Kong&#39;s convictions, which were used to upgrade Wu Kong in the recent raid event. It seems players really liked the new system of using materials obtained during the event to unlock nodes on his mana circles, and hope to see it in future events.</div><div>Okada: The new upgrade system using convictions was well-received by many players, so I want to keep doing that in future raid events.</div><div><br></div><div>I think the main reasons the feature was well-received were because, by obtaining the convictions upgrade items during the event, it was possible to upgrade the event adventurer Wu Kong without using existing upgrade items, and because upgrading Wu Kong meant that he grew significantly stronger during the event. Wu Kong had an ability that gave him an advantage during the event so he was used a lot, even in difficult quests like the Omega battles. I think that players were satisfied with this event because they were able to thoroughly upgrade Wu Kong and use him to defeat bosses.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: Some players shared feedback about shared skills. While they do expand the options for clearing quests, it seems like healer adventurers will become less useful since any adventurer can use healing skills.</div><div>Okada: The game&#39;s operations team had the same expectation regarding shared skills, but based on our data we have not seen healer adventurers suffering any sort of striking decrease in usage at this point in time. Furthermore, there are parts in high-difficulty quests where a healer adventurer is necessary, so I believe that healer adventurers are maintaining their usefulness at the moment.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: We&#39;ve received feedback that players would like it if it were not possible to use the dodge action repeatedly because, while the addition of invulnerability time to the dodge action was a good thing, players can become perpetually invulnerable by flicking repeatedly.</div><div>Okada: We discussed this a lot, but we settled on this mechanic because we wanted to make it easier for more players to challenge a wide breadth of quests. Going forward, I want to make high-difficulty quests that are predicated on this mechanic, but players won&#39;t be able to clear quests if all they do is dodge, so I think that increasing the methods for avoiding attacks expands on the gameplay.</div><div><br></div><div>As has been the case up until now, you can use a skill right when a red-action-marker attack activates to avoid taking damage while the skill is active, and you will always get hit if you are within the area of a purple-action-marker attack. You can dodge attacks by going outside the action marker&#39;s area (with some exceptions), so this just increases the number of ways you can dodge attacks. However, it does decrease the overall difficulty level, and players who had come up with strategies using older methods for dodging attacks may feel a little unsatisfied with that, but I do hope you will look forward to the content we will add in the future.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: Some players have shared feedback that they would like the capacity for rupies and mana you can hold to be increased.</div><div>Odaka: We are currently working on this. When the time comes, we will share more information in an update notification.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: What about the feedback from players about wanting to see the capacity for weapons, wyrmprints, and dragons increased?</div><div>Okada: We increased all players&#39; weapon, wyrmprint, and dragon capacities in the update the other day. I think this will make managing these things somewhat easier.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: There is feedback that using Summon Vouchers one by one is time consuming and players would like to be able to use multiple vouchers simultaneously.</div><div>Okada: This is currently in development as well, so please wait a little longer.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: We have another request from us this time too. The castle grounds are always bright and sunny, but it would be nice if there were a feature where the castle grounds changed to nighttime after 6 PM, or something like that! If the facilities glowed or if there were a decorative lighting display when it turned to nighttime, it might even increase the number of log-ins at night.</div><div>Okada: I&#39;ll keep that in mind. [Laughs] Thank you for the feedback.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: We&#39;d also like to share one request from our listeners. They say that they love how cute and energetic Sarisse is and are sad that she doesn&#39;t often get to play a part in the main campaign. Plus, since she is a Gala adventurer, unfortunately many people have not been able to get her and play as her in Dragalia Lost. To help even more people realize how great Sarisse is, they hope that you will give her more chances to shine in the main campaign and consider giving her out as a story adventurer.</div><div>Okada: Well, Sarisse is an important adventurer, so I&#39;ll keep that feedback in mind as well.</div><div><br></div><hr><div>Director Okada will continue to reply to the feedback players send via Leave Feedback again in the future. We&#39;re looking forward to hearing your comments.</div><div><br></div><div>Thank you for playing Dragalia Lost.</div>
