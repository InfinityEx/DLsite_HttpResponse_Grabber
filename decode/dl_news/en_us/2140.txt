message:<div><span style="color: rgb(41, 105, 176);"><strong>[Addendum <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1619578800"></span>]</strong></span></div><div>As a token of our appreciation, the following item has been sent to players who started playing before <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1619578800"></span>.<br>・Tenfold Summon Voucher &times; 1<br>This gift can be claimed from your goodie box for up to seven days after reception. If the gift isn&#39;t retrieved within seven days, it will be lost.</div><div><br>Thank you for playing Dragalia Lost.</div><div><br></div><hr><div>Version 2.7.0 will be available for download around <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1619492400"></span>. An automatic update will occur at approximately <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1619578800"></span>.</div><div><br></div><div>When you update to version 2.7.0 and play co-op, you will no longer be matched with players using earlier versions of the game. Rooms created by players playing earlier versions will not display in the Room List, and you will not be able to join them using Find a Room, Join Nearby Players, Enter an ID, or alliance chat.</div><div><br></div><div>To celebrate the update, we&#39;ll be sending all players a Tenfold Summon Voucher after the automatic update. This notice will be modified after it has been distributed.</div><div><br></div><div>Note: The Tenfold Summon Voucher will not be distributed until after the automatic update, even if you complete the update to version 2.7.0 early.</div><div><br></div><div>■Update Details</div><div>▼See What Loadouts Work Best With Suggested Teams!</div><div>Suggested Teams, a feature that allows players to browse and copy team loadouts that others have used to successfully clear certain quests, will be added. Data on the teams that were used to clear these quests will be recorded and the top performers will be made available for everyone&#39;s reference.</div><div><br></div><div>To see the top teams for an eligible quest (listed below), simply tap on the Suggested Teams button on the quest&#39;s selection screen. Levels, unbinds, and mana circle progress are shown at their highest values, while stat boosts from abilities, augments, facilities, and encyclopedia bonuses are not taken into account. If you&#39;d like to take one of the suggested teams for a spin, you can easily register it as one of your own.</div><div><br></div><div>When copying a suggested team loadout, if you do not have an adventurer, dragon, or wyrmprint (or sufficient copies) to match that of the suggested team, then that slot on your team will remain empty. If you do not have any of the four adventurers on the suggested team, then the first slot on your team will be filled by the Prince. If you do not have a weapon (or sufficient copies) to match that of the suggested team, then that slot on your team will be filled with a Battleworn version of the corresponding weapon.</div><div><br></div><div>When copying a team loadout, adventurers, dragons, weapons, and wyrmprints will be copied with your current upgrades, regardless of whether or not these upgrades differ from those displayed in the selected loadout.(For example, if the suggested team contains an adventurer who was promoted to 5★ but your version of them is still 4★, then that slot on your team will be filled with the 4★ version.)</div><div><br></div><div>The rarities, levels, and unbinding progress displayed on the Team Information screen for suggested teams are based on the adventurers, dragons, weapons, and wyrmprints in your collection.</div><div><br></div><div>The Suggested Teams feature may be used with the following quests in solo play: Advanced Dragon Trials: Standard/Expert/Master, The Agito Uprising: Standard/Expert/Master/Legend, Morsayati Reckoning, and Lilith&#39;s Encroaching Shadow: Standard/Expert. Additional quests will be made available in the future.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/7fbb4c30c86e3c68dcfe46c63054b6fb.png"></div><div><br></div><div>▼Stretch Your Stamina Farther with Reduced Costs!</div><div>The stamina cost of the following quests will be reduced in a data update around <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1619589600"></span>:</div><div><br></div><div>・Main campaign: all chapters</div><div>・Special events: Void Battles, Trials of the Mighty, raid events, facility events, limited-time events such as onslaught events and defensive events, Time Attack Challenges (including Void Battles, The Imperial Onslaught, and Advanced Dragon Trials; excluding quests equivalent to The Agito Uprising)</div><div>・Recurring events: Avenue to Power, Avenue to Fortune, Elemental Ruins, the Event Compendium</div><div>・Challenge events: Dragon Trials, The Imperial Onslaught, Advanced Dragon Trials</div><div><br></div><div>Please note that this change does not affect the amount of stamina recovered from the 30-Day Pack (Recovery) or from the use of wyrmite or honey, nor does it affect the type, amount, or rate of drop rewards from the above quests.</div><div><br></div><div>■Other Changes</div><div>・Players will be able to use looking glasses in the Treasure Trade starting on <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1619589600"></span>.</div><div>・The presentation of combo count information in the user interface will be improved.
