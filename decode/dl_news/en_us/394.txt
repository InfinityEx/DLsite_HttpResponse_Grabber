message:<div>Hello, everyone! It&#39;s the Dragalia Lost team here, to share news of an upcoming update.</div><div><br></div><div>Starting after the maintenance on Apr 25, 2019(PT)/Apr 26, 2019(UTC), we&#39;ll be changing how summoning works.</div><div><br></div><div>■Background Information</div><div>We&#39;ve received a lot of feedback since the game&#39;s release regarding summoning and adventurer building. The team has been reviewing this feedback and implementing it in the form of overall game balance, but have not yet been able to improve summoning in a way to really satisfy players.</div><div><br></div><div>Therefore, in order to create a game that you, the players, can enjoy even more, we&#39;re changing how summoning works. To go along with this, we&#39;ll also be changing how you can acquire wyrmprints as well as the amount of eldwater you&#39;ll get.</div><div><br></div><div>You can read about these changes below.</div><div><br></div><div>■Summoning Changes</div><div>Wyrmprints have appeared in summon showcases since launch, but after this update, they will no longer appear when summoning.</div><div><br></div><div>Even though wyrmprints will no longer appear in summon showcases, the total appearance rate for each rarity will remain unchanged as described below.</div><div><br></div><div>・5★ total appearance rate: 4.00%</div><div>・4★ total appearance rate: 16.00%</div><div>・3★ total appearance rate: 80.00%</div><div><br></div><div>For the appearance rates of featured adventurers and dragons after these changes are put into effect, check the appearance rates for the individual showcases after the maintenance starting at Apr 25, 2019(PT)/Apr 26, 2019(UTC) completes.</div><div><br></div><div>■Acquiring Wyrmprints</div><div>You&#39;ll be able to exchange eldwater for wyrmprints from the in-game Shop. This includes wyrmprints that have previously appeared in summon showcases. We also plan on making it so there is a low chance of acquiring some wyrmprints, including 5★ wyrmprints, from quests.</div><div><br></div><div>Check below for the amount of eldwater required for acquiring wyrmprints from the Shop.</div><div><br></div><div>Trade # &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5★ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4★ &nbsp; &nbsp; 3★</div><div>1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4,000 &nbsp; &nbsp;2,000 &nbsp; &nbsp;200</div><div>2 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;6,000 &nbsp; &nbsp;3,000 &nbsp; &nbsp;300</div><div>3 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;9,000 &nbsp; &nbsp;4,000 &nbsp; &nbsp;400</div><div>4 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;9,000 &nbsp; &nbsp;4,000 &nbsp; &nbsp;400</div><div>5 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;9,000 &nbsp; &nbsp;4,000 &nbsp; &nbsp;400</div><div><br></div><div>Note: From the sixth wyrmprint onward, the amount of eldwater required will reset, starting again with the amount required for the first trade.</div><div><br></div><div>■Changes to the Amount of Eldwater Acquired</div><div>Considering the amount of eldwater required to upgrade adventurers&#39; co-abilities, and now the amount required to obtain wyrmprints, we will be changing the amount of eldwater you can acquire.</div><div><br></div><div>The amount of eldwater you&#39;ll get when summoning a duplicate adventurer and when you part ways with a dragon you summoned will change as detailed below.</div><div><br></div><div>・5★</div><div>Before: 3,000</div><div>After: 8,500</div><div>・4★</div><div>Before: 1,000</div><div>After: 2,200</div><div><br></div><div>Note: There will be no changes to the amount of eldwater you get for 3★ adventurers and dragons, selling wyrmprints, or parting ways with dragons obtained from events or from the Treasure Trade menu.</div><div><br></div><div>■A Gift of Eldwater</div><div>We will be giving eldwater to players who meet either of the following conditions.</div><div><br></div><div>・Conditions:</div><div>1.
