message:<div>Hello! Yuji Okada here, director of Dragalia Lost.</div><div><br></div><div>I want to start by thanking you for playing Dragalia Lost.</div><div><br></div><div>In June we added chapter 14 to the main campaign, added a new flame-attuned boss, Ayaha &amp; Otoha, to The Agito Uprising, and held a new facility event, Rhythmic Resolutions. I hope you&#39;re enjoying these additions!</div><div>As those who played chapter 14 of the main campaign will know, a new adventurer joins your party when you clear the chapter.</div><div><br></div><div>There&#39;s also a Gala Dragalia that is currently live. In addition to Princess Chelle&#39;s shadow-attuned pactbound dragon, Gala Cat S&igrave;th, this showcase features water-attuned adventurers Eugene and Catherine, as well as water-attuned dragon Styx.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/ff3eb8f70f0ad102387d17026f06f668.png"></div><div><br></div><div>If you&#39;ve played Ayaha &amp; Otoha&#39;s Wrath on Expert difficulty then you may have already seen it, but during the battle the two will merge into a single entity. Check out this illustration of their merged form.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/328af1d91fc4fd307e77bb65ddbddfe7.png"></div><div><br></div><div>The Rythmic Resolutions facility event adds a new song, Bon Fever. The song is reminiscent of a bon dance, and there&#39;s also a pretty cool arrangement of it. This song was sung by Sekihan, performing as Marvelous Naoto.</div><div><br></div><div>■Halloween Elisanne&#39;s Mana Spiral</div><div>Thank you for all of the feedback you sent since we unlocked Halloween Elisanne&#39;s mana spiral on June 18. We&#39;re considering readjustments for Halloween Elisanne based on this feedback, taking into consideration the balance with other adventurers whose mana spirals have been unlocked. I apologize for the wait, but please be patient while we finalize these adjustments. Once the adjustments have been finalized, we&#39;ll share more information via notifications.</div><div><br></div><div>■Plans for This Month</div><div>・We&#39;ll unlock mana spirals for the following water-attuned adventurers on July 2.</div><div>Zardin, Ricardt, Karina, Luther, Xander, and Lily</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/69865690e71c96adfc5a78dbbbb175a4.png"></div><div><br></div><div>・A defensive event will start in mid-July.</div><div>Defensive events progress in a similar manner to the onslaught event held last month, but it&#39;ll be possible to play co-op in the Defensive Battle quests during this defensive event. We&#39;ve also adjusted things like enemy position for Defensive Battle quests, making it possible for players to divide up the task of defeating enemies and complete the quests more efficiently.</div><div><br></div><div>In the previous onslaught event, many players quit playing without completing it, possibly because it was necessary to repeat quests of every difficulty level. This time around, we smoothed out the quest progression and adjusted the balance to make it easier to obtain battle charts.</div><div><br></div><div>The theme of the story is summer vacation, and it&#39;ll feature new summer adventurers, so I hope you enjoy it!</div><div><br></div><div>・We&#39;ll also add The Hunt for Harmony facility event to the event compendium in mid-July.</div><div><br></div><div>・We&#39;ll revive the A Splash of Adventure raid event in late July.<br>The story for the A Splash of Adventure raid event is connected to the A Crescendo of Courage facility event, and we&#39;ll revive the A Crescendo of Courage facility event as well in late August.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/464cdf636d86d236a0457b4bba517417.png"></div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/059961c7f6cd8b60a8980b0b7e44533b.png"></div><div><br>・Additionally, at the end of July we&#39;ll add Master difficulty to the light-attuned boss Kai Yan in The Agito Uprising.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/6629e9efeca4dcb13f567c9db7cfd17a.png"></div><div><br>■Future Updates<br>・In a future update, we&#39;ll adjust the axe, bow, wand, and staff weapon types to make their force strikes easier to use.<br>These weapon types take a long time to charge their force strikes, and the users are sometimes attacked while charging, so we&#39;re currently adjusting them to be able to charge and release their force strikes while moving. We&#39;ll also adjust the force strike charge speed and power for some of them. We&#39;ll share more information about this in a future update notification.<br><br>・We&#39;ve seen a particularly large amount of reactions to the new ally who joins in chapter 14 of the main campaign.<br>We&#39;ll add an interlude to chapter 14 in late July, and will add chapter 15 in mid-August, so please look forward to those additions.<br><br>・A shadow-attuned boss will be added to The Agito Uprising at the end of August.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/d3052786c492f28a484ca80ea346652f.png"></div><div><br>■In Conclusion<br>We&#39;re giving all players the following items this month.<br><br>・Blessed Ethon Ashes x10</div><div>・Summon Voucher x3<br>・Sunlight Ore x3<br><br>The next installment of This Month in Dragalia Lost will be posted around August 1, 2020.<br><br>Until then, thanks for reading, and for continuing to play Dragalia Lost!<br><br>Yuji Okada<br>Director, Dragalia Lost<br><br>Notes:<br>・The gift can be claimed from your goodie box for up to seven days after reception.
