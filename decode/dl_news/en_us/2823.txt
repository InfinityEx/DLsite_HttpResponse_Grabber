More quests can be unlocked using battle charts, items that are unique to the event. After clearing all of the quests for a difficulty, you will receive a Victory Reward and the next difficulty will be unlocked.<br><br>To challenge the EX quest, you must collect battle charts to unlock the quest, then use a stratagem. Stratagems can be obtained from certain quests in the Romance Under Siege event, or as glory rewards, which are described below.<br><br>■Glory Rewards<br>Glory points are event-exclusive points that can be earned by clearing event quests.

For dragon battles that involve defeating a single boss, you must defeat the boss for the quest to count as cleared. For dragon battles that involve defeating waves of enemies, you must clear the final wave for the quest to count as cleared.<br><br>Adventurers must equip a dragon to participate. Adventurers that have a dragondrive are unable to participate in dragon battles even if they have a dragon equipped. Tiki may participate in dragon battles, even though she shapeshifts into a special Divine Dragon form instead of regular shapeshifting.<br><br>The adventurer that you are controlling will automatically shapeshift at the start of the quest and their shapeshift will have an unlimited duration. Unlike standard shapeshifting, you will take damage from enemy attacks. You will fail the quest if the HP of all of the adventurers in your team reaches zero.<br><br>Normally, when an adventurer equipped with the dragon Gala Chronos Nyx shapeshifts and performs standard attacks, dragon strikes, skills, or the automatic dodge effect granted by his ability, their remaining shapeshift time will be depleted. However, in Dragon Battles, performing these actions will deplete their remaining HP instead.<br><br>Additionally, you will start the quest with your skill gauge filled, so you can use your skill as soon as the quest starts.

The rules vary slightly in both cases. In single-adventurer dragon battles, you can only select one adventurer to participate.<br><br>The team creation for dragon battles limited to a single adventurer is separate from your normal teams and is unique to these quests. The team creation for dragon battles that require four adventurers uses your normal teams and all eligible adventurers can participate. If the team includes adventurers who use dragondrive instead of shapeshifting, a message that says &quot;Adventurers that have a dragondrive are unable to participate in dragon battles&quot; will display.<br><br>During dragon battles that require four adventurers, the adventurer you are controlling will automatically switch at the beginning of each wave. Only on the final wave of these quests will you be able to freely switch the adventurer that you are controlling. You cannot switch the shapeshifted adventurer you are controlling in the first or middle waves.<br><br>■Treasure Trade Rewards<br>You can earn primal crystals by playing event quests and trade them for various rewards on the Treasure Trade menu.<br><br>■Endeavors<br>These endeavors can only be attempted for the duration of the event.
