An automatic update will occur at approximately <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1624590000"></span>.</div><div><br></div><div>When you update to version 2.9.0 and play co-op, you will no longer be matched with players using earlier versions of the game. Rooms created by players playing earlier versions will not display in the Room List, and you will not be able to join them using Find a Room, Join Nearby Players, Enter an ID, or alliance chat.</div><div><br></div><div>To celebrate the update, we&#39;ll be sending all players a Tenfold Summon Voucher after the automatic update. This notice will be modified after it has been distributed.</div><div><br></div><div>Note: The Tenfold Summon Voucher will not be distributed until after the automatic update, even if you complete the update to version 2.9.0 early.</div><div><br></div><div>■Update Details</div><div>▼Smooth Out the Edges with Anti-Aliasing!</div><div>Anti-aliasing can be enabled in the game&#39;s settings to smooth out jagged edges on 3D models and improve the overall appearance of the game&#39;s graphics. Please note that this feature cannot be enabled on the iPad mini 4 or iPad Air 2.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/1355a0efca96ad160ffb6174258e1f6f.png"></div><div><br></div><div>▼Keep Track of Trials with Ease!</div><div>The Trials of the Mighty schedule will be available directly from the Trials of the Mighty quest screen, allowing easier access to this important information.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/657a086af44270b446f98a2984e58d62.png"></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>▼Enjoy an Improved Battle Experience!</div><div>The gameplay experience during battles will be improved as follows.</div><div><br></div><div>・More powerful attacks will cause the camera to shake more violently. Players who find this distracting can disable camera shake in the game&#39;s settings.</div><div>・Enemies will be knocked back based on the direction that the player is facing (instead of the direction that they are facing) when the attack connects.</div><div>・The visual effect that is displayed when an attack connects will be based on the attack&#39;s strength. When a Punisher-type ability connects, the effect will be shown in black. Unique effects such as overdamage will be given priority when attempting to display multiple effects at once.</div><div><br></div><div>■Other Changes</div><div>・The summon animation of certain dragons will be adjusted.</div><div>・The user interface will be adjusted in various places.</div><div><br></div><div>■Quality-of-Life Improvements</div><div>・If an adventurer&#39;s dragondrive gauge becomes empty while they are using a skill during dragondrive, dragondrive will be deactivated after the skill is finished.</div><div><br></div><div>■Issues Addressed</div><div>・Ordinarily, a single adventurer is not able to equip two wyrmprints of the same name at the same time. However, it has come to our attention that wyrmprints that drop from Rise of the Sinister Dominion quests with the same name but different affinities can be equipped by a single adventurer at the same time, granting the stats, abilities, and affinity bonuses of both. This behavior is not intended. After updating to version 2.9.0, players will not be able to embark on a quest if two Rise of the Sinister Dominion wyrmprints of the same name are equipped by any adventurer on the team. Such wyrmprints will be automatically unequipped during maintenance around <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1624582800"></span>.</div><div>・While playing Ayaha &amp; Otoha&#39;s Wrath on Expert or Legend difficulty, if Ayaha (human form) is defeated under certain conditions while performing an attack that requires both Ayaha and Otoha to act simultaneously (such as Niramekko), she will not transform into her beast form and the game may freeze.</div><div>・While the Display Preference for Mana Circles is set to &quot;2D,&quot; if the player selects an adventurer whose fourth mana circle has been fully unbound, then fully unbinds their fifth mana circle, the voice line that is supposed to play when all of their mana circles are fully unbound may not play.</div><div>・If the adventurer Child Ranzal uses the Swing for the Fences skill while inspired, then uses the skill again, it will deal critical damage a second time.</div><div>・While playing Jaldabaoth&#39;s Piercing Gale on Master difficulty in co-op, the connection to the game may be interrupted when Jaldabaoth&#39;s elemental attunement changes.</div><div>・While playing Jaldabaoth&#39;s Piercing Gale in co-op, the visual effects that appear when Jaldabaoth uses Sacrificial Ceremony may not be displayed on guest devices.</div><div>・While playing Jaldabaoth&#39;s Piercing Gale in co-op, Jaldabaoth may behave unexpectedly if the connection from a guest device is interrupted when he performs a certain action.</div><div>・While playing Jaldabaoth&#39;s Piercing Gale on Standard or Expert difficulty in co-op, certain attacks performed by the Deceitful Puppets summoned by Fallen Angel Gabriel may target the wrong adventurer.</div><div>・While playing Jaldabaoth&#39;s Piercing Gale in co-op, Jaldabaoth may suffer damage despite being protected by Invulnerability.</div><div>・While playing Jaldabaoth&#39;s Piercing Gale, the icon that indicates which of Jaldabaoth&#39;s attacks can be countered by the overdrive counter mechanic may appear off-center.</div><div><br></div><div>Notes:</div><div>1. It may take time for the store to reflect the updated information. Players may not be able to perform updates due to their device&#39;s data cache being full. If you are unable to perform the update, restart your device, and then try downloading it from the store.</div><div>2. Any adventurers and game screenshots shown are still in development.</div><div><br></div><div>Thank you for playing Dragalia Lost.</div>
