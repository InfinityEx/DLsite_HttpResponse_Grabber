Unbinding weapons<br>Unlock a weapon&#39;s unbinding nodes to increase the maximum number of times that its HP &amp; Strength nodes can be unlocked.<br><br>In Version 1.23.1 and earlier, unbinding was performed using copies of a weapon.

Fortifying Jewels (the specialized items that increase the HP provided by a weapon in Version 1.23.1 and earlier) will be removed.<br>Note: Because weapons may no longer be improved with augments, we will not be adding Amplifying Jewels (the specialized items that increase the strength provided by a weapon) previously announced for a future update.</div><hr><div><br></div><div><strong>■Weapon Functionality</strong><br>1. Copies of weapons<br>In Version 1.23.1 and earlier, multiple copies of the same weapon could be obtained. In the next update and beyond, only one of each weapon may be obtained.

Weapon slots<br>Each weapon will come with a certain number of slots.<br><br>In Version 1.23.1 and earlier, up to two wyrmprints could be equipped to an adventurer. In the next update and beyond, wyrmprints will be equipped to weapons instead, and can be equipped in a number equal to the number of slots in the weapon.<br><br>The number of slots that a weapon has will vary from weapon to weapon, and slots can be added to a weapon until it has five, allowing it to equip up to five wyrmprints.<br><br>Slots come in two types:<br>・Slots for 5★ wyrmprints (up to three per weapon)<br>・Slots for 2★, 3★, or 4★ wyrmprints (up to two per weapon)<br><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/d9cc12a50ee56f2e56e4da638f57e6db.png"></div><div><br></div><div>3. Weapon bonuses<br>By unlocking the weapon bonus for elemental weapons from each group, players can boost their adventurers&#39; stats depending on the type of weapon that they wield. These boosts are reflected on the Castle Information screen.<br><br>Weapon bonuses for certain Agito weapons will be added in the future.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/bc5f9da9e3335b8cd6a468e32d57a456.png"></div><div><br></div><div>4. Weapon abilities<br>In Version 1.23.1 and earlier, individual weapons came with a variety of abilities that provided advantages in Void Battles, Astral Raids, and Advanced Dragon Trials. In the next update and beyond, these same individual abilities can be made available as generalized weapon abilities by upgrading certain weapons.<br><br>The weapon abilities that are available to a particular weapon will depend on the weapon&#39;s type, and these abilities will take effect regardless of what weapon an adventurer has equipped, as long as the adventurer&#39;s weapon type and element match that of the weapon ability.<br><br>Therefore, you will no longer need to equip a specific weapon with an ability tailored for a particular enemy in order to benefit from it as long as you have previously unlocked that weapon ability for the weapon type that you are using.<br><br>Certain weapons will unlock weapon skins when their weapon abilities are unlocked. The list of weapon abilities that you have unlocked can be viewed in-game.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/e26dc1e67c40738e506bc8a80b249523.png"></div><hr><div><br></div><div><strong>■Other Changes</strong><br>1.
