If you play the event, you&#39;ll have the chance to build one for your Castle Grounds!<br><br>The Festival Stage boosts the stats of adventurers who wield swords or lances. It also boosts the damage that adventurers deal against enemies in event quests. Progress through the event story and level up your Festival Stage!<br><br>Equip the event-specific wyrmprint Best Buds to receive more ornate lanterns, which are used to upgrade the Festival Stage. Use this wyrmprint to get the most out of this event!<br><br>Please note that special effects conferred by event-specific wyrmprints do not apply if you begin a quest during the event period but complete the quest after the event period has ended.<br><br>■Additions<br>・New maximum level unlocked for the event facility!<br>The Festival Stage event facility can now be leveled up to a maximum of level 35.<br><br>■Event Duration<br><span class="local_date" data-local_date="1626328800"></span> to <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1627538399"></span><br><br>■Reward Availability Period<br><span class="local_date" data-local_date="1626328800"></span> to <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1628143199"></span><br><br>■Event-Exclusive Facility: The Festival Stage<br>This facility increases the stats of adventurers who use swords or lances. It also confers a special effect that lets you deal more damage to enemies in these event quests. The strength of this effect increases as you level up the Festival Stage. This effect only applies for the duration of this event. To level up the Festival Stage, you&#39;ll need ornate lanterns, which you can find in these event quests.<br><br>■If You Already Obtained the Festival Stage<br>If you already have the Festival Stage from a past event, you will receive wyrmite instead.<br><br>■Upgrade Item: Ornate Lanterns<br>You can get these from the story quests, boss battle, and extra boss battle for the Rhythmic Resolutions facility event revival.<br><br>■Boss Battles<br>Boss battles are quests where you can face off against boss enemies that appear in the event story. Rewards vary depending on the difficulty cleared. This quest can be played either solo or co-op.<br><br>■Extra Boss Battles<br>Although the difficulty level of extra boss battles is higher than the event boss battle on Expert difficulty, the rewards are generous and the battles do not cost stamina or getherwings. Extra boss battles occasionally appear after clearing the event boss battle on Expert difficulty.<br><br>Even if you clear the boss battle several times in a row using the auto-repeat feature, the extra boss battle will only become available once at most. It will disappear again after being successfully cleared. Once the conditions for the quest are met, you can unlock it repeatedly. This quest can be played either solo or co-op.<br><br>■Challenge Battles<br>Challenge battles are high-difficulty quests limited to solo play and are available in Expert, Master, and Nightmare difficulties. The Expert difficulty challenge battle is unlocked after completing the event boss battle on Expert difficulty, and the Master difficulty challenge battle will unlock when you complete the Expert difficulty challenge battle.<br><br>The Nightmare difficulty challenge battle will become available on <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1626588000"></span>, and you must complete the Master difficulty challenge battle to play it. Even if you complete the Master difficulty challenge battle, you will not be able to play the Nightmare battle until it is available.<br><br>These quests will have you testing your strength against waves of enemies. If you fail to reach the last wave in Expert or Master difficulty, you will still receive rewards for the ones you did clear, but in Nightmare difficulty you must complete the final wave to earn rewards.<br><br>Finally, the drop rate for rewards differs based on the difficulty. The drop rate for rewards in Nightmare difficulty is the same as Master difficulty. Once per day when you clear Nightmare difficulty, you can get a Grand Bounty. The Grand Bounty you receive is randomly selected from a set of rewards.<br><br>■Festival Spirit Rewards<br>Festival spirit points are event-exclusive points that can be earned by clearing event quests. Collect them to earn all kinds of rewards!<br><br>■Treasure Trade Rewards<br>You can earn energizing fans and crunchy nougat by playing event quests and trade them for various rewards on the Treasure Trade menu. What&#39;s more, in this event you&#39;ll be able to trade ornate lanterns, which are required to level up the Festival Stage event facility, for energizing fans and crunchy nougat, which are only used in the Treasure Trade, and vice versa.<br><br>■Event Bonuses<br>The following wyrmprints will have bonus effects during this event:<br><br>・Best Buds<br>・Once in a Lifetime<br>・Catch Me in the Sunflowers<br><br>If you equip these wyrmprints and clear event quests, you&#39;ll get even more ornate lanterns and festival spirit points.<br><br>You can get Best Buds from endeavor rewards. Once in a Lifetime and Catch Me in the Sunflowers are available in the Treasure Trade for wyrmprints. (The amount of event bonus effect differs based on the wyrmprint and how much the wyrmprint has been unbound.)<br><br>■Endeavors<br>These endeavors can only be attempted for the duration of the event.
