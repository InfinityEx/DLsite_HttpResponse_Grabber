message:<div>To Everyone Playing Dragalia Lost,<br><br>Nice to meet you.<br><br>My name is Matsuura, and I&#39;m the director of the game.<br><br>Thank you for the time you&#39;ve spent playing Dragalia Lost.<br><br>It&#39;s been a little more than a month since the game released on 9/27, and I hope you&#39;ve been enjoying it.<br><br>The raid event Kindness and Captivity is currently running, and we&#39;ve implemented all kinds of adjustments based on your feedback and gameplay of October&#39;s raid event, Loyalty&#39;s Requiem. You can find the details of these adjustments in the update notifications, so I hope you get a chance to check them out.<br><br>As things stand currently, it will still take some time before the game balance reaches the level envisioned by the development team. We&#39;ll continue working hard to get to that point.<br><br>I know you&#39;re all having fun leveling up the different adventurers and trying out different team formations, and since I&#39;d like you all to read each of these characters&#39; stories to the very end, we&#39;re looking into ways to make adjustments for you to raise characters from level 1 up to the midpoint of their max level.<br><br>In order for that to happen, we&#39;ll be making some adjustments to how character-upgrade materials (such as rupies, mana, and crystals) work and how much of each you&#39;ll need to perform upgrades. It may take some more time before these adjustments become reality, but we like to think it will be worth the wait.<br><br>We&#39;ll have details on this in an update sometime later this month.<br><br>Finally, I would like to give a gift to everyone who is playing Dragalia Lost.<br><br>▼Gift details:<br>・50,000 mana<br>・100,000 rupies<br>・30 gold crystals<br><br>This message will be updated when the items have been distributed.</div><div><br></div><div><span style="color: rgb(41, 105, 176);"><strong>Addendum added <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1541397600"></span></strong></span><br>We have sent the following items to anyone who started the game by <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1541394000"></span>.<br><br>・50,000 mana<br>・100,000 rupies<br>・30 gold crystals<br><br>Items sent as gifts can be collected from your goodie box.<br>You can collect these until <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1541998740"></span>.<br><br>Thank you for playing Dragalia Lost.</div>
