message:<div>On August 30, 2020, Dragalia Lost director Yuji Okada replied to feedback players sent via the in-game Leave Feedback feature.</div><div><br></div><div>This notification contains the contents of an interview with director Okada that was conducted by Yumi Uchiyama and Ayaka Asai, voice actors for the Japanese-language version of Dragalia Lost.</div><div><br></div><div>Notes:</div><div>・The feedback featured in this notification was chosen from feedback received between July 6 and July 31.</div><div>・Tap Feedback on the game&#39;s title screen to open the Leave Feedback screen.</div><div>・The content of the interview has been edited for this notification, so wording may differ from the original conversation.</div><div>・The content of the responses is from the time of the interview, so content that is in-development may differ by the time of release in-game.</div><div><br></div><hr><div>■Responses to Feedback</div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: We&#39;ve received feedback that players have been using the latest adventurers and unlocking mana spirals for their roster, but they feel that the balance between enemy strength and adventurer performance is still a bit skewed. In co-op, the same adventurers are being used over and over again and many adventurers and dragons are difficult to use, so players are requesting that this balance be adjusted.</div><div>Okada: We strive to balance quests in such a way that a variety of adventurers can be used to clear them, but I think that certain players who play co-op are mainly interested in using whichever adventurer can clear the quest the easiest. Going forward, we hope to strike a balance where this sort of thing happens as little as possible. To start, we have some improvements planned in an update in the near future. Thank you for your patience.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: Some players feel that their 5★ adventurers have become outclassed by 4★ adventurers who have recently had their their mana spirals unlocked, which is a shame because they spent valuable upgrade materials on the former. Making 4★ adventurers stronger is fine in principle, but perhaps their mana spiral strength is a bit overtuned in practice?</div><div>Okada: Certain adventurers may become extremely strong when used together properly in co-op. This is not the case when they are used alone, but there are players who know how to take advantage of this careful teamwork.</div><div><br></div><div>If I may, I&#39;d like to transition to a related topic: currently shadow-attuned adventurers and dragons are able to output much more damage than their counterparts. We&#39;ve been adjusting the damage output ceiling for each element ever since the game released. Even so, when comparing shadow-attuned adventurers with those of other elements, it&#39;s hard not to feel that the latter group is slightly lacking. This is another balance issue that we plan to address in the coming update.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: Regarding the Doomsday Getaway raid event, some players thought that the story was interesting and enjoyed logging in every day to read the latest episode. However, during the fight with the raid boss it was difficult to understand that her opening attack makes it impossible to control the adventurer in the first slot of your team. It would have been nice to know that beforehand, perhaps as part of some event tips or other information.</div><div>Okada: The idea was to have the boss turn the adventurer who you were controlling at the beginning of the raid battle into a doll with her first attack, forcing you to use a different adventurer. In the future, we will attempt to include important details like this in the information and images provided in-game.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: Some players have expressed difficulty discerning the difference between the red and purple action markers that denote an attack&#39;s area in the Agito Uprising battles Kai Yan&#39;s Wrath and Ayaha &amp; Otoha&#39;s Wrath and hope to be able to customize these colors themselves in the future.</div><div>Okada: I understand that red and purple action markers may be difficult to discern among similar colors on the underlying terrain. During development we checked their visibility and adjusted accordingly, but we will check this mechanic even closer in the future.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: We have a question from us this time as well. We asked about plans for the second anniversary of Dragalia Lost last episode, and the big day will be here in under a month now, so we thought we&#39;d ask again. Do you have anything more to share on this topic?</div><div>Okada: We are still busy with various preparations for the second anniversary. As I explained at the beginning of this episode, various balance adjustments will be part of the update, not only for adventurers and dragons, but for the enemies you face as well, with the ultimate goal being making the game more accessible for everyone. With that said, we will strive to maintain the challenge that these enemies present. Since there are too many of these large-scale changes to name here, I kindly ask that you wait for upcoming notifications for further details.</div><div><br></div><div>Around mid-September, we plan to revive the Fractured Futures raid event that was held last year during the first anniversary. You&#39;ll be able to enjoy the story of the upcoming second anniversary event even better if you&#39;re familiar with the stories of the main campaign and this past raid event, so I wholeheartedly recommend that players get caught up on the main campaign and participate in the raid event revival when they have the chance.</div><div><br></div><div>We have a lot more updates in store for the second anniversary, including some additional features. This will be one of our biggest updates ever, so I hope everyone is looking forward to really digging in! We&#39;ll be able to share more around mid-September, so stay tuned.</div><div><br></div><hr><div>Director Okada will continue to reply to the feedback players send via Leave Feedback again in the future. We&#39;re looking forward to hearing your comments. (The feedback featured in the next notification will be chosen from feedback received between August 1 and August 31.)</div><div><br></div><div>Thank you for playing Dragalia Lost.</div>
