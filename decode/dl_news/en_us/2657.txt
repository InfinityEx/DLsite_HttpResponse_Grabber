This quest will push your roster to its limits, so prepare as best you can!</div><div><br></div><div>・The Great Dragonyule Offensive onslaught event will return in mid-December.</div><div><br></div><div>・Part one of chapter 23 of the main campaign will be added in late December. With every new chapter, we draw closer and closer to the heart of the story. In particular, we will learn what happened in the aftermath of the Faith Forsaken raid event. If you&#39;re not caught up on that story or just need a refresher, the Faith Forsaken (Part One) and Faith Forsaken (Part Two) events will be added to the Event Compendium in late December.</div><div><br></div><div>・Various events are planned to ring in the new year at the end of December. For further information, please see the corresponding notification and information on our official Twitter account when it is posted.</div><div><br></div><div>■Future Updates</div><div>・The long-awaited Enter the Kaleidoscape mode will be added in the next update. You begin your journey by selecting a single adventurer from your roster to explore the labyrinth. There&#39;s only one goal: reach the bottom in one piece! Your adventurer begins at level 1 but will increase in both level and strength as they collect weapons, wyrmprints, and more from treasure chests and defeated enemies. Keep your wits about you and see how far into the mysterious Kaleidoscape&#39;s depths you can reach!</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/7543a3db1948942a6351b71c05517238.png"></div><div>You can equip a single weapon and up to three wyrmprints at any given time. Even if this equipment appears identical on the surface, each has its own varied collection of stats, skills, and abilities, so be sure to examine your loadout down to the finest detail and upgrade when something better comes along.</div><div><br></div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/55562e51790ddd6cba705158d0d8e841.png"></div><div>Skills can be found in treasure chests or dropped by defeated enemies. You can choose from eight different shared skills. If that seems a little overwhelming, fear not: the battle will be put on hold while you evaluate which is best to use.</div><div><br></div><div>As you progress through the labyrinth, powerful bosses will attempt to stand in your way. Once defeated, they will drop multiple dragons&mdash;but you can only keep one, so choose wisely. Choosing the dragon with the particular abilities that best suit your current strategy will be key to surviving the ever-changing challenges you&#39;ll face.</div><div><br></div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/bfc07dc411566db4e74100bd6024acdd.png"></div><div>Like skills, you can choose which dragon to shapeshift into from the collection that you&#39;ve amassed along your journey. The action will remain paused while you decide who to shapeshift into, so read the battlefield and evaluate your options carefully. Note that certain rules apply to adventurers with unique shapeshifts or dragondrive gauges.</div><div><br></div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/56c7c0b68942703e7b8bec5f6507b5b6.png"></div><div>Everyone needs a helping hand now and then, and this fafnir has your back. You&#39;re still in the driver&#39;s seat, but as you explore and fight, the fafnir will provide support by attacking enemies and restoring your HP.</div><div><br></div><div>・For further information on the Enter the Kaleidoscape mode and its mechanics, please see the corresponding notification when the mode is released.</div><div><br></div><div>■In Conclusion</div><div>Thank you for reading this month&#39;s update.
