title_name:Regarding Adjustments to Adventurer and Dragon Balance
image_path:

message:<div>The balance of certain adventurers and dragons has been adjusted in the Version 2.0.0 update to make it easier to use a greater variety of them when taking on quests. The balance of weapons has also been adjusted with this goal in mind.</div><div><br></div><div>In Version 1.23.1 and earlier, the damage output of shadow-attuned adventurers was stronger than those of the other four elements (flame, water, wind, and light), leading players to prioritize their inclusion in teams regardless of whether or not shadow had the elemental advantage in a particular quest.</div><div><br></div><div>Based on the above imbalance, we have widely adjusted the balance of adventurers, dragons, and weapons as described below such that adventurers and dragons of various elements are able to perform well in a variety of situations.</div><div><br></div><div>■Adventurer adjustments</div><div>Certain adventurers have had the power of one or more of their skills increased. For details on how a particular adventurer was changed, please see the section describing each change below.</div><div><br></div><div>One exception to this is the adventurer Vice, who was balanced after a reduction in skill power was applied. For further details, please see the following notification:</div><div><br></div><div><a href="https://dragalialost.com/en/news/detail/1625">Regarding Adjustments to the Adventurer Vice</a></div><div><br></div><div>If a skill&#39;s power was increased, then its skill gauge was made to fill more slowly when it is used as a shared skill. To prevent this power increase from making skills too powerful on their own, the damage of every adventurer&#39;s normal attack was also increased. The power of normal attacks was adjusted according to every element.</div><div><br></div><div>■Dragon adjustments</div><div>The attack damage that dragons of every element deal while shapeshifted was increased.</div><div>Note: Gala Thor was excluded from this adjustment.</div><div><br></div><div>■Weapon adjustments</div><div>The Lv. 2 weapon skills of flame-, water-, wind-, and light-attuned Agito weapons were adjusted as follows:</div><div><br></div><div>・Flame: changed effect that increases strength by 20% to 40%</div><div>・Water: added effect that increases strength by 20%</div><div>・Wind: changed effect that increases strength by 25% to 40%</div><div>・Light: changed effect that increases strength by 20% to 40%</div><div><br></div><div>■Other adjustments</div><div>The parameters of enemies appearing in the following quests have been adjusted:</div><div><br></div><div>・Void Zephyr Strike</div><div>・Void Agni Strike</div><div>・Void Poseidon Strike</div><div>・Void Jeanne d&#39;Arc Strike</div><div>・Void Nidhogg Strike</div><div>・Volcanic Chimera Strike</div><div>・Tidal Chimera Strike</div><div>・Tempest Chimera Strike</div><div>・Luminous Chimera Strike</div><div>・Ebon Chimera
