Players can craft a 4★ non-elemenal manacaster if their Smithy is Lv. 4 or higher.</div><div>・Because void manacasters cannot be crafted at this time, crafting a high dragon version does not require a void version (unlike the other weapon types). Instead, crafting a high dragon manacaster requires a fully upgraded 5★ non-elemental core manacaster and Smithy Lv. 7+.</div><div>・For further details on weapons, tap Upgrade at the bottom of the screen, then tap Weapons/Crafting.</div><div><br></div><div>Thank you for playing Dragalia Lost.</div>
