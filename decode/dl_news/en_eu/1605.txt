Abilities</div><div>In Version 1.23.1 and earlier, each wyrmprint could typically have up to two abilities, and some with certain event perks had three. In the next update and beyond, each wyrmprint will typically have one ability (not including wyrmprints with event perks, which may have two).</div><div><br></div><div>After these changes are implemented, the abilities of existing wyrmprints may be different than they were before.</div><div><br></div><div>In addition, wyrmprints of the same rarity but different names may have the same abilities.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/874422bf87a57d36c0c86e37ce2767ce.png"></div><div><br></div><div>2. Number that can be equipped</div><div>The number and rarity of wyrmprints that can be equipped on a particular weapon depends on the number of slots that weapon has. Each weapon may equip up to three 5★ wyrmprints and up to two 2★, 3★, or 4★ wyrmprints.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/b384356149d82b41d35f5e0ca570270a.png"></div><div><br></div><div>3. Copies</div><div>In Version 1.23.1 and earlier, multiple copies of the same wyrmprint could be obtained and equipped on different members of a team. In the next update and beyond, additional copies to equip to members of a team can be unlocked by upgrading an individual wyrmprint.</div><div><br></div><div>Up to four copies of a wyrmprint may be unlocked by spending eldwater (excluding certain wyrmprints). A wyrmprint cannot be equipped on more than one member of a team unless one or more of its copies are unlocked.</div><div><br></div><div>If a player obtains a wyrmprint that they already have, it will be converted into eldwater and rupies. In addition, wyrmprint storage will be removed.</div><div><br></div><div>4. Affinity Bonuses</div><div>Certain wyrmprints will have an affinity. There are eleven affinities in total, and equipping multiple wyrmprints with the same affinity will activate an affinity bonus, providing various ability effects. Ability effects provided by affinity bonuses will stack with ability effects provided by wyrmprints but do not share limits.</div><div><br></div><div>For example, if four wyrmprints with the Crown&#39;s Boon affinity are equipped, the Skill Damage +10% ability effect will activate.</div><div><br></div><div>Note: For details on the number of affinities required to activate an affinity bonus and the effects that affinity bonuses provide, please check the All Affinity Bonuses section of the wyrmprint selection screen accessible when editing teams in-game.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/f27617896ea400c28a03e12046742913.png"></div><div><br></div><hr><div><br></div><div><strong>■Wyrmprint upgrades</strong><br>1. HP &amp; Strength<br>In Version 1.23.1 and earlier, a wyrmprint&#39;s stats were upgraded by leveling it up. In the next update and beyond, the HP and strength stats will be upgraded by unlocking HP &amp; Strength nodes. Unbinding a wyrmprint will be necessary to upgrade these stats to their maximum values.<br><br>2. Unbinding wyrmprints<br>Unlock a wyrmprint&#39;s unbinding nodes to increase the maximum number of times that its HP &amp; Strength nodes can be unlocked.<br><br>In Version 1.23.1 and earlier, unbinding was performed using copies of a wyrmprint. Since only one of each wyrmprint may be obtained in the next update and beyond, unbinding them will be performed by spending eldwater (excluding certain wyrmprints) instead.<br><br>A wyrmprint&#39;s ability effects will be upgraded based on the number of times that it has been unbound. The &quot;vestige refined&quot; effect that alters a wyrmprint&#39;s art will continue to unlock at the second stage of unbinding, and silver keys and golden keys may continue to be used to unbind wyrmprints.<br><br>3. Augmenting wyrmprints<br>In Version 1.23.1 and earlier, the HP and strength stats of a wyrmprint could be augmented up to +100 each. In the next update and beyond, these stats may be augmented up to +50 each.<br><br>Augment items used in Version 1.23.1 and earlier will be returned to affected players when goodwill gestures for these changes are provided.<br><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/034cd489879e5debc5e8d559318290e7.png"></div><hr><div><br><strong>■Wyrmprints available in The Imperial Onslaught Treasure Trade and Treasure Trade for Wyrmprints</strong><br>Trades will be limited to a maximum of one of each wyrmprint, and players who already have one of a wyrmprint will not be able to trade for it.<br><br>Unlike the wyrmprints mentioned earlier, unbinding and unlocking copies of the following wyrmprints will require materials other than eldwater:<br><br>・Greatwyrm Midgardsormr<br>・Greatwyrm Mercury<br>・Greatwyrm Brunhilda<br>・Greatwyrm Jupiter<br>・Greatwyrm Zodiark<br>・Glorious Tempest<br>・Queen of the Blue Seas<br>・Volcanic Queen<br>・King of the Skies<br>・Ruler of Darkness<br><br>Players must have fully unbound the Greatwyrm Midgardsormr wyrmprint in order to trade for the Glorious Tempest wyrmprint.
