message:<div>Hello, everyone!</div><div><br></div><div>This is Matsuura, the director of Dragalia Lost. Before we dive into part three of What&#39;s Ahead for Dragalia Lost, I&#39;d like to say--thank you to everyone who&#39;s been playing the game!</div><div><br></div><div>So, today I&#39;ll be dishing out information on various in-game events, as well as some information on the game&#39;s direction and future updates.</div><div><br></div><div>■Event Information</div><div><br></div><div>Void Battles started at <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1550815200"></span>. Since you can&#39;t play this content until you clear chapter 7 of the campaign, if you haven&#39;t reached that point yet, I hope you&#39;ll make it through so you can check this out!</div><div><br></div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/cd5458a8c6e76062b192dc0fa6ea0086.png"></div><div><br></div><div>The enemies you can fight in Void Battles change every day. We&#39;ve prepared a variety of rewards for clearing these, including weapons, dragons, and facilities, so we hope you give it a try.</div><div><br></div><div>Unlike enemies you&#39;ve fought up until now, these enemies each have unique abilities. That means it may take a bit of effort to beat them! But if you are having trouble, you can check the Details button at the top of each quest screen for hints on how to win.</div><div><br></div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/95c60102a1c735c95acb99cd289ba4ab.png"></div><div><br></div><div>Three new Void enemies will be added on <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1553061600"></span>, so I&#39;ll take this opportunity introduce you to two of them.</div><div><br></div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/0b2a34d7b47ad3c7bd79c6ed0c43c50d.png"></div><div><br></div><div>This is the shadow-attuned Obsidian Golem. You may have encountered the flame-attuned Steel Golem already, so now you can meet the shadow-attuned version of that enemy.</div><div><br></div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/795b486090d1b91184c494c543aab130.png"></div><div><br></div><div>This is the flame-attuned Blazing Ghost, which comes with a new ability: Ranged Resistance. This ability makes it difficult for adventurers with bows, staves, and wands to deal damage, so I&#39;d recommend using adventurers with other weapon types.</div><div><br></div><div>Some of the weapons you can craft from Void Battles will be useful for Advanced Dragon Trials, so if you enjoy playing Void Battles, you can strive to challenge the Advanced Dragon Trials next.</div><div><br></div><div>Additional quests to take on and weapons to craft will be added every month. So although the weapon types may be limited at the moment, you can look forward to seeing them increase in the future.</div><div><br></div><div>Now, regarding the facility event scheduled to start on <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1552370400"></span>...we&#39;ve added just a dash of horror to give this one a little something extra compared to past events.</div><div><br></div><div>Something creeps forth from the chaos...</div><div><br></div><div>See the notification for more information.</div><div><a href="unity:Information_286">A New Facility Event, The Accursed Archives, Is Coming Soon!</a></div><div>I hope you&#39;re looking forward to this one, too!</div><div><br></div><div>Though it was some time ago, Dragalia Lost is now available in six additional countries, and I&#39;m delighted that players in countries all over the world are now enjoying the game. It&#39;s been nearly half a year since its release and we&#39;re planning a variety of events to celebrate!</div><div><br></div><div>First up, we&#39;ll be implementing a login bonus starting on <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1553061600"></span> to count down to the half anniversary. So be on the lookout for more information about that!</div><div><br></div><div>■Update Information</div><div><br></div><div>Now I have five updates to share with you all.</div><div><br></div><div>1. Equipping two wyrmprints</div><div><br></div><div>I know we&#39;ve kept you waiting, but here&#39;s an update regarding equipping two wyrmprints.</div><div>We&#39;re working on implementing it as such:</div><div><br></div><div>・You can equip two wyrmprints per adventurer.</div><div>・However, one adventurer cannot equip two of the same wyrmprint.</div><div>・If you equip two wyrmprints which have the same effect, the effects will stack up to a certain limit.</div><div>・The feature will unlock after completing chapter 4.</div><div><br></div><div>This is still in development, so the points here are still subject to change. But we&#39;ll continue to update you in the future.</div><div><br></div><div>2. Creating conditional rooms when playing co-op</div><div><br></div><div>When playing co-op, you&#39;ll be able to create rooms with certain conditions for entry.</div><div>You&#39;ll be able to set element, weapon type, and might as conditions, and you&#39;ll match with players who meet those conditions when they select Find a Room.</div><div><br></div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/af042a8559748ca0e2c92f4ada6cc587.png"></div><div><br></div><div>This should prove useful for challenging those high-difficulty quests.</div><div>Also, you&#39;ll be able to choose to battle again if you fail a quest.</div><div><br></div><div>3. Trading for insufficient materials on the spot</div><div><br></div><div>When you don&#39;t have enough materials for mana circles, building facilities, or crafting, you&#39;ll be able to remain on those screens and trade without going to Treasure Trade in the shop.</div><div><br></div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/90fd23398b3e573609eaebb0fa864f5f.png"></div><div><br></div><div>4. New button to change game speed</div><div><br></div><div>We&#39;ll be adding a button which will let you change the speed of the game when playing a quest.</div><div><br></div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/c93e208abac8aa6c35e3a6f05e1cd0a9.png"></div><div><br></div><div>This feature will only be available during solo play, but it will increase the overall game speed when enabled.</div><div><br></div><div>We are preparing four speeds: Normal, 1.2x, 1.5x, and 2x.</div><div><br></div><div>You can set it to 2x when playing with auto enabled to play twice as fast, or you can take control yourself and enjoy battling at twice the speed.</div><div><br></div><div>Personally, I think that the fastest I could enjoy controlling is 1.5x speed...but in any case, it&#39;s a different way to play the game, so I hope you check it out!</div><div><br></div><div>5. High Midgardsormr&#39;s Trial: Prelude added</div><div><br></div><div>We&#39;re adding a new Prelude difficulty to High Midgardsormr&#39;s Trial. With this difficulty, it will be easier for you to practice the High Midgardsormr fight.</div><div><br></div><div>Also, you&#39;ll be able to fight without the Glorious Tempest wyrmprint, so why not give it a try? However, do note that you won&#39;t get the epithet for clearing this difficulty.</div><div><br></div><div>Along with this change, we also plan to make slight adjustments to the rewards for Advanced Dragon Trials.</div><div><br></div><div>High Midgardsormr&#39;s Trial: Prelude will be released in the near future, while the other items described here are scheduled for the end of March.</div><div><br></div><div>■Future Updates</div><div><br></div><div>This time I introduced updates for March, but we&#39;ve also got a big update planned for the end of April. It&#39;ll be our biggest yet... Something to really look forward to!</div><div><br></div><div>So, what did you think of What&#39;s Ahead for Dragalia Lost, Part 3? We strive to provide content you can look forward to enjoying every day.</div><div><br></div><div>Thank you for playing Dragalia Lost!</div><div><br></div><div>Hiroki Matsuura</div><div>Director, Dragalia Lost</div><div><br></div><div>Note:</div><div>・Any adventurers and game screenshots shown are still in development.</div>
