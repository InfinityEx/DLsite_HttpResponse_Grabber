message:<div>On April 25, 2021, Dragalia Lost director Yuji Okada replied to feedback players sent via the in-game Leave Feedback feature.</div><div><br></div><div>This notification contains the contents of an interview with director Okada that was conducted by Yumi Uchiyama and Ayaka Asai, voice actors for the Japanese-language version of Dragalia Lost.</div><div><br></div><div>Notes:</div><div>・The feedback featured in this notification was chosen from that received between March 1 and March 31.</div><div>・Tap Feedback on the game&#39;s title screen to open the Leave Feedback screen.</div><div>・The content of the interview has been edited for this notification, so wording may differ from the original conversation.</div><div>・The content of the responses is from the time of the interview, so content that is in development may differ by the time of its release in-game.</div><div><br></div><hr><div>■Responses to Feedback from Players</div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: Players, particularly those who didn&#39;t catch their favorite adventurer&#39;s summon animation the first time around, are happy that this animation and extras like voice clips are available to access at any time thanks to the addition of Notte&#39;s Notes. To that end, players have requested the addition of Memories for dragons and adventurers who do not appear in summon showcases.</div><div><br></div><div>Okada: Since players directly receive a group of 3★ adventurers to help them get off on the right foot when they begin the game, they never have a chance to see those particular summon animations, but we will consider adding them since this feature of Notte&#39;s Notes has received so much interest. Regarding dragons, we know that many 5★ dragons in particular have unique animations that can only be seen when summoning them, so we will consider adding those in the future as well.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: Players have written in to express appreciation for the quality-of-life improvements made to team editing, including wyrmprint decks. However, it seems that the user interface makes it difficult for some to understand the proper way to select, register, and copy their loadouts, resulting in unwanted changes or overwritten teams. Would you consider adding an &quot;undo&quot; button or a record of previously used teams to alleviate these sorts of issues in the future?</div><div><br></div><div>Okada: We have heard that this particular part of the user interface can be confusing and will work on improving its usability. That goes for the functionality too; we will consider how best to implement further features like a solo-play team history.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: Curse of Nihility, which removes certain buffs and nullifies their effects in Rise of the Sinister Dominion, has been welcomed by some players who appreciate that it doesn&#39;t allow them to simply stack buffs and wipe the boss out, but lamented by others who feel that it prevents certain adventurers and dragons from reaching their full potential. As an example, the nullification of the energy mechanic hurts light-attuned teams more than others since so many light-attuned adventurers use it.</div><div><br></div><div>Okada: We designed Curse of Nihility with the goal of making Rise of the Sinister Dominion a challenge, particularly in how to utilize your own unique roster to deal with its core mechanic. Buff removal in particular may be a little harsh on the energy mechanic since Curse of Nihility can make it difficult for an adventurer to become energized. With that said, our intention was not to limit choices&mdash;just the opposite, in fact. We wanted to push players to explore their roster and take a second look at adventurers and dragons who may have fallen by the wayside in favor of already-established teams. As we continue to add different elemental attunements to this series of quests, we hope that players will discover more about the potential of their roster as a whole.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: With the recent increase to both the number of skip tickets that players can hold and the number that they can use at once, some have been asking for more methods to earn them. Perhaps they could be used as a way to encourage more co-op play by being added to the rewards that you can earn from playing with others?</div><div><br></div><div>Okada: We can definitely understand how being able to use up to 30 skip tickets at once can quickly cause your stockpile to dwindle, and we will consider implementing ways for players to earn more.</div><div><br></div><hr><div>Director Okada will continue to reply to the feedback players send via Leave Feedback again in the future. We&#39;re looking forward to hearing your comments. (The feedback featured in the next notification will be chosen from feedback received between April 1 and April 30.)</div><div><br></div><div>Thank you for playing Dragalia Lost.</div>
