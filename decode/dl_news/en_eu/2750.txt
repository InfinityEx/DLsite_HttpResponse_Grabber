message:<div>On December 26, 2021, Dragalia Lost director Yuji Okada replied to feedback players sent via the in-game Leave Feedback feature.</div><div><br></div><div>This notification contains the contents of an interview with director Okada that was conducted by Yumi Uchiyama and Ayaka Asai, voice actors for the Japanese-language version of Dragalia Lost.</div><div><br></div><div>Notes:</div><div>・The feedback featured in this notification was chosen from that received between November 1 and November 30.</div><div>・Tap Feedback on the game&#39;s title screen to open the Leave Feedback screen.</div><div>・The content of the interview has been edited for this notification, so wording may differ from the original conversation.</div><div>・The content of the responses is from the time of the interview, so content that is in development may differ by the time of its release in-game.</div><hr><div><br></div><div>■Responses to Feedback from Players</div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: A player wrote in to us regarding the days that the Alberian Battle Royale is held. They work on weekdays, and they are unable to participate in the event when work is busy. It might be helpful to players in similar situations if the event were playable at any time, or if not, at least on Fridays and Saturdays as well.</div><div><br></div><div>Okada: We want people from all walks of life to be able to play, so we&#39;ve changed it to be playable at all times. Please enjoy the Alberian Battle Royale whenever you would like.</div><div><br></div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: A player wrote in to request that older raid events be added to the Event Compendium. While these raid events have returned as revivals in the time since their initial release, newer players may not have had the chance to get adventurers and dragons from raid events that are over two years old.</div><div><br></div><div>Okada: I am thinking we will add some events that are closely related to the main story to the Event Compendium. In the meantime, we plan to continue to run event revivals, so players who haven&#39;t had a chance to make certain adventurers or dragons their allies can look forward to those.</div><div><br></div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: One player wrote in to share how much they enjoyed Dragonyule Nevin&#39;s adventurer story. They said they love the relationship between the apostles and angels, so they&#39;d like to see more of them.</div><div><br></div><div>Okada: Thank you for the kind words. The apostles and angels did a lot in the third-anniversary event, and I think they&#39;ve become compelling adventurers and dragons. I feel their combination is a special aspect of Dragalia Lost. I want to continue to provide stories and other content that players can enjoy, and I&#39;d be very happy if you&#39;d look forward to them. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><hr><div>Director Okada will continue to reply to the feedback players send via Leave Feedback again in the future. We&#39;re looking forward to hearing your comments. (The feedback featured in the next notification will be chosen from feedback received between December 1 and December 31.)</div><div><br></div><div>Thank you for playing Dragalia Lost.</div>
