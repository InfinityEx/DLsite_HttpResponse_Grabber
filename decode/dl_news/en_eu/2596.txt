message:<div>Hello, everyone! Yuji Okada here, director of Dragalia Lost.</div><div><br></div><div>First off, as always, thank you for playing Dragalia Lost. I&#39;m again excited to bring you the latest news on what&#39;s happening in and around the game this month.</div><div><br></div><div>■The Latest Chapter of the Main Campaign is Here!</div><div>・Part one of chapter 22 of the main campaign was added on <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1635746400"></span>. We jumped a bit ahead in the timeline for the Faith Forsaken raid event last month, so returning to the plot of the main campaign may be a bit jarring at first, but I hope that you&#39;ll enjoy learning more about Nedrick&#39;s past and what happens when he and the prince come face-to-face. Parts one and two each feature their own special boss, so make sure your teams are in fighting form!</div><div><br></div><div>・Don&#39;t forget about the daily free tenfold summon event! The 5★ dragon Gala Chronos Nyx appears in a Gala Dragalia available now. You can learn more about him by reading the dragon story for Chronos Nyx, who appeared in the Fractured Futures and Rage of Chronos raid events.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/be760a7bfc3b72827518308984fa5140.png"></div><div><br></div><div>■Regarding the Clockwork Heart Facility Event</div><div>・In The Clockwork Heart facility event available now, you can acquire an event-exclusive facility: Dr. Schmidt&#39;s lab. This facility boosts the stats of adventurers who wield blades or staffs and boosts the damage that adventurers deal against enemies in event quests. Be sure to level it up as you progress through the event!</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/7e3c950ef393246d2e33ebe5d4622164.png"></div><div><br></div><div>This event tells the tale of the adventurers Halloween Sylas and Halloween Laxi, who are also featured in a Gala Dragalia available now.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/e0d7de45b9e80dbd2fabdbc443d88e3b.png"></div><div><br></div><div>■Plans for This Month</div><div>・Speaking of Halloween, limited-time adventurers and dragons with a Halloween theme will return in a summon showcase starting on <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1636005600"></span>.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/b033eee8574dd199787d43bdea70bf8e.png"></div><div><br></div><div>This summon showcase will be available during the Free Hundredfold Summon event, but remember that you can only perform one hundred summons for free for a single day, so don&#39;t miss out!</div><div><br></div><div>What&#39;s more, this particular summon showcase will allow you to redeem an adventurer or dragon of your choice for only 200 wyrmsigils instead of the usual 300. The list of redeemable adventurers and dragons will include those with a Halloween theme as well as some other additions. You can confirm which adventurers and dragons are available by tapping the Wyrmsigils button on the summon showcase&#39;s page in the Summon menu.</div><div><br></div><div>・An onslaught event will be held in mid-November. The story is set in a courtroom and a certain braggart from the Halidom will moonlight as a lawyer seeking to right some wrongs. Will justice be served, or will chaos ensue?</div><div><br></div><div>・The Phantom&#39;s Ransom facility event will return in mid-November. Build and upgrade the event-exclusive facility, the opera house, to boost the stats of adventurers who wield bows or manacasters.</div><div><br></div><div>・Legend difficulty for Lilith&#39;s Encroaching Shadow (a first for Rise of the Sinister Dominion) and flame-element quests up to level 70 for the Mercurial Gauntlet will be added. Both of these additions will push your roster to its limits, so prepare as best you can!</div><div><br></div><div>・Harle&#39;s Trial will be added to Trials of the Mighty in mid-November. Materials for unlocking Gala Leif&#39;s mana spiral will be available from the daily bonus.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/f39f11afee99d413b2e631a899288c2a.png"></div><div><br></div><div>・A Time Attack Challenges event pitting you against flame-attuned enemies will be held in late November.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/f03037137e1ca242449eda7ba325bec1.png"></div><div><br></div><div>・Part two of chapter 22 of the main campaign will be added in late November. I can&#39;t say too much about the story since part one was just released, but I hope you&#39;re looking forward to testing your team&#39;s mettle against the special boss.</div><div><br></div><div>■Future Updates</div><div>・Legend difficulty for Jaldabaoth&#39;s Piercing Gale in Rise of the Sinister Dominion will be added in early December.</div><div><br></div><div>・Additional dragons will be able to be unbound up to five times instead of four in late November.
