In order to figure out why, the prince and his friends break the seal on a mysterious library... But this led to greater mysteries still. What awaits them is a garden of madness beyond description. Absolute and nightmarish chaos. In a library enveloped by riddles and fear, can they discover the ultimate truth?<br><br>■Event Overview<br>In The Accursed Archives, you can acquire an event-exclusive facility: the Library Obscura. If you play the event, you&#39;ll have the chance to build one for your Halidom!<br><br>The Library Obscura boosts the stats of shadow-attuned adventurers, which you&#39;ll want to use in this event. It also boosts the damage that adventurers deal against enemies in event quests. Progress through the event story and level up your Library Obscura.<br><br>Equip the event-specific wyrmprint Hitting the Books to receive more forbidden knowledge when clearing quests. You can also equip the wyrmprint The Heretic&#39;s Laboratory (available from the Treasure Trade for wyrmprints) to receive more arcane tomes, which are used to upgrade the Library Obscura. Use both of these wyrmprints to get the most out of this event!<br><br>Please note that special effects conferred by event-specific wyrmprints do not apply if you begin a quest during the event period but complete the quest after the event period has ended.<br><br>■Additions<br>・New maximum level unlocked for the event facility!<br>The Library Obscura event facility can now be leveled up to a maximum of level 35.<br><br>■Event Duration<br><span class="local_date" data-local_date="1603087200"></span> to <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1603778399"></span><br><br>■Reward Availability Period<br><span class="local_date" data-local_date="1603087200"></span> to <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1604383199"></span><br><br>■Event-Exclusive Facility: Library Obscura<br>Building the Library Obscura in your Halidom increases the stats of shadow-attuned adventurers.
