message:<div>On June 27, 2021, Dragalia Lost director Yuji Okada replied to feedback players sent via the in-game Leave Feedback feature.</div><div><br></div><div>This notification contains the contents of an interview with director Okada that was conducted by Yumi Uchiyama and Ayaka Asai, voice actors for the Japanese-language version of Dragalia Lost.</div><div><br></div><div>Notes:</div><div>・The feedback featured in this notification was chosen from that received between May 1 and May 31.</div><div>・Tap Feedback on the game&#39;s title screen to open the Leave Feedback screen.</div><div>・The content of the interview has been edited for this notification, so wording may differ from the original conversation.</div><div>・The content of the responses is from the time of the interview, so content that is in development may differ by the time of its release in-game.</div><div><br></div><hr><div>■Responses to Feedback from Players</div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: Players who have just begun playing the game have written in to say that they appreciate the current functionality of Notte&#39;s Notes, but would love to see a feature that allows them to read the story of past main campaign chapters and events.</div><div><br></div><div>Okada: We are working toward the addition of just such a feature in the future. I hope that players who are looking forward to re-reading past main campaign chapters and events will enjoy this feature once it is released.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: Players wrote in to praise the co-op gameplay of the new invasion event, The Children of Yggdrasil. They enjoyed the fast-paced race to defeat as many enemies as possible, but felt that the impact of their individual contribution was hard to discern amid all of the chaos. Players may be motivated to fight even harder if they had a tangible measure of their performance, such as seeing how many enemies they had defeated in comparison to their teammates on the results screen.</div><div><br></div><div>Okada: We struggled to find the best approach to this during development, but in the end we decided that we wanted these invasion events to focus not on a player&#39;s individual contribution, but on working together as a team. We also wanted to create a co-op environment in which players don&#39;t have to worry so much about meeting might requirements. Therefore, we consciously avoided designing ways for players to compare and contrast their performance against one another.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: Some players have expressed the desire to use skip tickets in the Event Compendium. Given that there are now so many quests to complete there, it can be time-consuming to collect all of the necessary items.</div><div><br></div><div>Okada: It is indeed true that the number of events only continues to rise, and collecting all of the required items for facility events in particular can take some time. With that in mind, we will consider implementing the ability to use skip tickets in the Event Compendium.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Uchiyama &amp; Asai: Players have found success using instructional stickers, &quot;Shapeshift now!&quot; in particular, to direct the action during important moments in co-op quests. Players would like to request more of such stickers, such as &quot;Dispel now!&quot;</div><div><br></div><div>Okada: That&#39;s a great idea. I will work together with the rest of the development team to see what we can come up with.</div><div><br></div><hr><div>Director Okada will continue to reply to the feedback players send via Leave Feedback again in the future. We&#39;re looking forward to hearing your comments. (The feedback featured in the next notification will be chosen from feedback received between June 1 and June 30.)</div><div><br></div><div>Thank you for playing Dragalia Lost.</div>
