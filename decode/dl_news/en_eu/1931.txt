Players may retry this process as many times as they like until they are satisfied with their 50 summons.

Players will not obtain eldwater for duplicate adventurers, and the summon animations for this tutorial summon differ from those of previous summon showcases. Information regarding appearance rates may be found on the summon details screen.</div><div><br></div><div>With the implementation of the improved tutorial summon, the existing free post-prologue tutorial tenfold summon that guarantees one 4★ or higher adventurer or dragon and the summon that grants the choice of one 5★ adventurer from a certain selection of them will be removed.</div><div><img src="https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/63ebb58585107c487694f17ff64ac7e4.png"></div><div><span style="color: rgb(41, 105, 176);"><strong>[Addendum <span class="local_date" data-local_date="1611651600"></span>]</strong></span><br>▼More Unlockable Adventurer Skins for The Alberian Battle Royale<br>The skins of certain adventurers that could not be unlocked in the Alberian Battle Royale before Version 2.4.0 will be made unlockable.
